       "The 2002 FIFA World Cup was a pivotal moment in the history of international football, marking the first time the tournament was hosted in Asia and co-organized by Japan and South Korea. Held from May 31 to June 30, 2002, it featured 32 teams competing for global glory, captivating audiences worldwide with thrilling matches, cultural exchanges, and unexpected outcomes. This event not only showcased the sport's universal appeal but also highlighted advancements in technology, stadium infrastructure, and fan engagement, setting the stage for future tournaments.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Historical Context\n",
       "\n",
       "The FIFA World Cup traces its roots back to 1930, when the first edition was held in Uruguay, and has since grown into the most-watched sporting event on the planet. By 2002, the tournament had expanded significantly, with the 1998 edition in France drawing record viewership. The 2002 World Cup was particularly noteworthy as it broke new ground by being hosted in Asia, fulfilling FIFA's goal of global inclusivity. This shift came after decades of European and South American dominance, reflecting the sport's rising popularity in other regions and addressing geopolitical efforts to promote unity through sports.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Tournament Format and Significance\n",
       "\n",
       "The 2002 World Cup followed a familiar format: 32 teams were divided into eight groups of four, with the top two teams from each group advancing to a single-elimination knockout stage. This structure, which included group-stage matches, round of 16, quarterfinals, semifinals, and the final, ensured high-stakes drama and strategic gameplay. The tournament's significance extended beyond the pitch; it was a symbol of international cooperation, as co-hosts Japan and South Korea demonstrated successful collaboration despite historical tensions. Additionally, upsets like South Korea's semi-final run and the emergence of stars like Ronaldo underscored the event's role in inspiring new generations and elevating football's global stature."

       "The 2002 FIFA World Cup marked a historic milestone as the first tournament co-hosted by two nations: Japan and South Korea. This decision, announced in 1996, was driven by FIFA's aim to promote football across Asia and foster regional unity. Japan, with its advanced infrastructure and growing football enthusiasm, hosted 10 matches, including the opening game in Sapporo. South Korea, equally enthusiastic, managed 10 matches as well, with the final held in Yokohama, Japan. The co-hosting arrangement highlighted cultural exchanges, with matches spread across both countries to showcase their distinct heritages. This setup not only boosted tourism and economic growth in both nations but also symbolized peace and cooperation on the Korean Peninsula, despite ongoing geopolitical tensions.\n",

       "### Key Stadiums and Logistics\n",
       "The 2002 World Cup featured 20 state-of-the-art stadiums across Japan and South Korea, each designed to accommodate large crowds and enhance the spectator experience. In Japan, iconic venues included the Yokohama International Stadium (site of the final match) and the Saitama Stadium, known for its modern architecture and capacity of over 60,000. South Korea's highlights were the Seoul World Cup Stadium and the Daegu Stadium, which hosted key group-stage and knockout games. Logistics were meticulously planned to handle the influx of fans, with high-speed trains and efficient public transport systems connecting venues. FIFA coordinated seamless operations, including security measures and bilingual signage, to ensure smooth travel between host cities. This infrastructure not only facilitated the tournament's success but also left a lasting legacy, with many stadiums continuing to host major events today."

       "\n",
       "The 2002 World Cup featured some of the most iconic goals and performances in football history. Brazil's Ronaldo, often called \"O Fenômeno,\" delivered a stellar performance, scoring twice in the final against Germany to secure Brazil's fifth World Cup title with a 2-0 victory. His resilience after previous injuries made this a triumphant comeback story. Another memorable moment was Rivaldo's audacious goal against Turkey in the group stage, where he chested the ball down and volleyed it into the net, showcasing Brazil's flair. Japan's Hidetoshi Nakata and Senegal's surprise run, led by players like El Hadji Diouf, also stood out, with Turkey's third-place finish highlighted by Ümit Davala's contributions, making this tournament a celebration of underdogs and stars alike.\n",

       "### Controversial Decisions and Incidents\n",
       "\n",
       "Controversies marred several matches, drawing scrutiny to officiating and player conduct. One of the most infamous incidents involved Brazil's Rivaldo during the group stage match against Turkey; after being hit by a ball, he dramatically fell to the ground, leading to a red card for Turkey's Hakan Ünsal and widespread criticism for simulation. Refereeing decisions also came under fire, such as in the England vs. Argentina round-of-16 match, where debatable calls, including a disallowed goal, influenced the outcome and fueled accusations of bias. These events raised questions about fair play and the use of technology in football, underscoring the tournament's dramatic edge."

       "    instructions=\"You are an intelligent Agent tasked with answering user questions that may require external knowledge. Given the input fields `question` (the user's query) and `trajectory` (a history of your previous thoughts, tool calls, and observations), your goal is to generate the outputs: `next_thought` (a clear, step-by-step reasoning about the current state and your plan for the next action), `next_tool_name` (the name of the tool to use next, either 'search_wikipedia' or 'finish'), and `next_tool_args` (a dictionary in JSON format specifying the arguments for the selected tool).\\n\\nAvailable tools are:\\n(1) search_wikipedia: Use this to query Wikipedia for information. It requires a single argument: {'query': 'a string representing the search term'}.\\n(2) finish: Use this when you have gathered all necessary information to answer the question, marking the task as complete. It requires no arguments: {}.\\n\\nIn each turn, begin by writing `next_thought` to analyze the `question` and `trajectory`, reason logically about what information is missing, and decide on the next step. Then, select the appropriate `next_tool_name` and provide `next_tool_args` in valid JSON format. After a tool is executed, its observation will be added to the `trajectory` for your next iteration. Continue this process iteratively until you can confidently produce the final answer, at which point you should select 'finish'. Always ensure your reasoning is concise, accurate, and directly tied to the question, drawing from examples like verifying if certain entities are plants by searching Wikipedia step-by-step.\"\n",

Finally, provide the `answer` as a brief, direct, and accurate response that directly answers the question without extraneous details, drawing solely from the trajectory\\'s data.
