One day, an evil army attacked this peaceful little kingdom and stole the Triforce of Power. This army was led by Ganon, the powerful Prince of Darkness who sought to plunge the World into fear and darkness under his rule. Fearing his wicked rule, Zelda, the princess of this kingdom, split up the Triforce of Wisdom into eight fragments and hid them throughout the realm to save the last remaining Triforce from the clutches of the evil Ganon. At the same time, she commanded her most trustworthy nursemaid, Impa, to secretly escape into the land and go find a man with enough courage to destroy the evil Ganon. Upon hearing this, Ganon grew angry, imprisoned the princess, and sent out a party in search of Impa.\"\n   \n\n\n\n    \"Braving forests and mountains, Impa fled for her life from her pursuers. As she reached the very limit of her energy she found herself surrounded by Ganon's evil henchmen. Cornered! What could she do? ... But wait! All was not lost. A young lad appeared. He skillfully drove off Ganon's henchmen, and saved Impa from a fate worse than death.\"\n   \n\n\n\n    \"His name was Link. During his travels, he had come across Impa and Ganon's henchmen. Impa told Link the whole story of Princess Zelda and the evil Ganon. Burning with a sense of justice, Link resolved to save Zelda, but Ganon was a powerful opponent. He held the Triforce of Power. And so, in order to fight off Ganon, Link had to bring the scattered eight fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom together to rebuild the mystical triangle. If he couldn't do this, there would be no chance Link could fight his way into Death Mountain where Ganon lived.\"\n   \n\n\n\n    \"Can Link really destroy Ganon and save Princess Zelda?\n   \n\n\n\n    \"Only your skill can answer that question. Good luck. Use the Triforce wisely.\"\n   \n\n\n\n    Gameplay\n   \n\n\n   The game itself introduces a new level of gaming, one that includes roleplaying, action, adventure, and puzzle/logic.\n  \n\n\n\n     Dungeon\n    \n    Exploration\n   \n\n\n   Barring\n   Link\n   's progress are\n   Creatures\n   he must battle to locate the entrances to nine underground\n   Dungeons\n   . Each\n   \n    Dungeon\n   \n   is a unique, maze-like collection of rooms connected by doors and secret passages and guarded by monsters different from those found on the\n   Overworld\n   .\n   \n    Link\n   \n   must successfully navigate each\n   \n    Dungeon\n   \n   to obtain one of the eight pieces of the\n   Triforce of Wisdom\n   .\n   \n    Dungeons\n   \n   also conceal useful items, such as a\n   Boomerang\n   for retrieving items and stunning\n   \n    Enemies\n   \n   and a\n   Flute\n   with magical properties. The first six\n   \n    Dungeons\n   \n   have visible entrances, but the remaining three are hidden. Except for the final\n   \n    Dungeon\n   \n   , which can't be entered until the previous eight have been completed, the order of completing\n   \n    Dungeons\n   \n   is somewhat arbitrary, but many\n   \n    Dungeons\n   \n   can only be reached using items gained in the previous one.\n  \n\n\n\n     Overworld\n    \n    Exploration\n   \n\n\n   Non-linearity, the ability to take different paths to complete the game, separated\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   from its contemporaries.\n   \n    Link\n   \n   can freely wander the\n   \n    Overworld\n   \n   , finding and buying items at any point. This flexibility enables unusual ways of playing the game; for example, it's possible to reach the\n   final Boss\n   of\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   (but not defeat him) without taking a\n   Sword\n   . Nintendo of America's management initially feared that players might become frustrated with the new concept, left wondering what to do next. As a result, the American version of the game's manual contains many hints, tips, and suggestions for players.\n  \n\n\n    Second Quest\n   \n\n\n   After completing the game, the player has access to a more difficult quest, officially referred to as the\n   \n    Second Quest\n   \n   , where\n   \n    Dungeons\n   \n   and the placement of items are different, with\n   \n    Enemies\n   \n   stronger. Although a more difficult \"replay\" wasn't unique to\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   , few games offered a \"second quest\" with entirely different levels to complete. Entering \"ZELDA\" as the player's name starts the\n   \n    Second Quest\n   \n   immediately.\n   The\n   \n    Second Quest\n   \n   can be replayed each time it's completed.\n  \n\n\n    Game Information\n   \n\n\n\n    Development\n   \n\n\n   Shortly before starting development for\n   \n\n     Super Mario Bros.\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n    Shigeru Miyamoto\n   \n   began developing\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   as a launch title for the\n   Famicom\n   Disk System.\n   Miyamoto got inspiration from his own explorations to the countryside and hillsides around his home for an adventure game.\n   Seeking to create a fairytale setting, co-developer\n   \n    Takashi Tezuka\n   \n   drew inspiration from\n   \n    J. R. R. Tolkien's\n   \n\n\n     Lord of the Rings\n    \n\n   novels when writing the story.\n   With the\n   \n    medieval\n   \n   sword and sorcery theme set, Miyamoto wanted to have treasure hunting gameplay to also bring in the sense of adventure seen in movies such as\n   \n\n     Indiana Jones\n    \n\n   .\n   The game began as a two player dungeon creator, but later became a one-player game with underground dungeons that surrounded\n   \n    Death Mountain\n   \n   , with forests, lakes, and\n   \n    Hyrule Field\n   \n   added eventually as they wanted to explore aboveground too. Miyamoto wanted to call the game\n   \n    The Legend of\n   \n   something, so a PR planner suggested\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   , the name of\n   \n    F. Scott Fitzgerald\n   \n   's wife.\n  \n\n\n    Japanese Version\n   \n\n\n\n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   was originally released in 1986 as a flagship title for the\n   Famicom Disk System\n   in Japan. Apart from facilitating data saving, the disk drive also added an extra sound channel on top of the Famicom's original five. This has caused the original release to sport a quite different sound compared to the more widespread cartridge release. This difference is most notable during the title screen.\n  \n\n   The\n   Book of Magic\n   is known as the\n   \n    Bible\n   \n   in the Japanese version of the game. This was likely changed because it violated Nintendo of America's, at the time, very strict content guidelines which among others disapproved of any religious content or references inside games released for their systems. Interestingly enough, all depictions of the cross were kept intact.\n  \n\n   The Japanese Famicom Disk System version was included in a promotional package of Charumera-brand ramen, and was only given out as a prize for a contest. It is unknown what differences this version has compared to the original release, as the only available copies are incredibly expensive.\n  \n\n\n    Graphics and Audio\n   \n\n\n   Being a game designed for storage in a floppy disk, the game's graphics do not use too many elements; sprites are given different color palettes depending on their location in the overworld. For example, trees can be colored either green or orange; brick walls in dungeons are painted blue, green, yellow or white, and so on.\n  \n\n   The game features three background themes: the overworld tune, the standard dungeon tune and the final dungeon tune. The first theme has become the franchise's main theme, and it is often reused in other games in the franchise. The dungeon theme is used as the theme for the\n   Royal Crypt\n   in\n   \n\n     The Minish Cap\n    \n\n   and in the\n   \n    Color Dungeon\n   \n   in\n   \n\n     Link's Awakening DX\n    \n\n   . Sound samples such as the one when Link collects a new item and the one when a new path is open are also often reused in later\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   games.\n  \n\n   The Japanese Famicom Disk System version of the game utilizes the Disk System's additional frequency-modulation synthesis chip; the music sounds more lifelike as a result.\n  \n\n\n    Setting\n   \n\n\n   With this game being the first in the franchise, it is the first time\n   \n    Hyrule\n   \n   is portrayed, and it is divided into numerous parts and landscapes, such as the\n   \n    Lost Woods\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Death Mountain\n   \n   , a central lake, a\n   forest\n   , a\n   \n    graveyard\n   \n   , and a shore; as Link walks through them, he manages to find the hidden labyrinths where the fragments of the\n   \n    Triforce\n   \n   are kept. It's unknown whether or not the nameless regions reappeared in later games with official names.\n  \n\n   Unlike most overworlds in\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   series, this incarnation of Hyrule is entirely explorable from the beginning, meaning that Link can go to almost any corner and space of it, with a total absence of linearity. It should be noted that the overworld remains largely unchanged in the\n   \n    Second Quest\n   \n   , with the only changes being the locations of the labyrinths and of special prizes.\n  \n\n\n    Timeline Placement\n   \n\n\n   According to the\n   \n    timeline\n   \n   revealed in\n   \n\n     Hyrule Historia\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   takes place in the \"Downfall\" branch, which, in a whole, takes place after\n   \n\n     Ocarina of Time\n    \n\n   . After\n   \n    Ganon\n   \n   is defeated in\n   \n\n     A Link to the Past\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n\n     Oracle of Seasons\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Oracle of Ages\n    \n\n   and in\n   \n\n     A Link Between Worlds\n    \n\n   where Link and Zelda recovered the Triforce from Yuga-Ganon, Hyrule entered The Golden Era, in which the wise\n   \n    Hyrule monarchs\n   \n   used the Triforce to govern the land. After the\n   \n    king\n   \n   's death and the attempt of the\n   \n    Prince of Hyrule\n   \n   to assemble the complete Triforce, Hyrule was lead into the 'Era of Decline'. The Prince of Darkness, Ganon was revived, leading to the events of\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   . Six years later, the events of\n   \n    The Adventure of Link\n   \n   take place.\n  \n\n   Both this game and its sequel are linked in continuity, since the first game revolves around retrieving two of the major fragments of the Triforce, and Ganon is fought in order to rescue\n   \n    Princess Zelda\n   \n   ; the second game revolves around finding the third major fragment in order to revive an incarnation of Zelda that was comatose for a very long time, and to impede the revival of Ganon.\n  \n\n\n    Mistranslations\n   \n\n\n\n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   is littered with mistranslations, direct word-for-word translations, and odd quotes.\n  \n\n\n    The intro story is written poorly, such as stating the Triforce piece Ganon stole is the \"Triforce with power\", instead of\n    \n     Triforce of Power\n    \n    . For the GBA and Wii Virtual Console ports, the message was entirely rewritten.\n   \n\n    This is the first\n    \n     Zelda\n    \n    game in which Ganon is written as\n    \n     Gannon\n    \n    . This spelling was also used in the Famicom Disk System version of\n    \n     The Adventure of Link\n    \n    and in the Super Famicom release of\n    \n     A Link to the Past\n    \n    .\n   \n\n    The Old Man is well known for his vagueness in messages. One of his most famous quotations is \"DODONGO DISLIKES SMOKE\", indicating the\n    \n     Dodongo\n    \n    's weakness to\n    \n     bombs\n    \n    . Another odd quote is \"DIGDOGGER HATES CERTAIN KINDS OF SOUND\".\n   \n\n    The list of items is titled \"all of treasures\". The \"of\" was omitted in subsequent re-releases.\n   \n\n    When Link pays the\n    \n     Old Woman\n    \n    behind the waterfall, she will tell him to \"Go up, up, the mountaintop.\" This was corrected to saying, \"Go up, up, the mountain ahead\". This refers to the path to\n    Level 5\n    .\n   \n\n\n\n    Credits\n   \n\n\n   In the\n   credits\n   , all but the executive producer\n   \n    Hiroshi Yamauchi\n   \n   are listed under pseudonyms. Designer\n   \n    Takashi Tezuka\n   \n   is credited as \"Ten Ten,\" sound composer\n   \n    Koji Kondo\n   \n   as \"Konchan,\" programmer I. Marui as \"Marumaru.\" At the time, nicknames were commonly used among Japanese game developers as a company measure against employee poaching.\n  \n\n   Producer and director\n   \n    Shigeru Miyamoto\n   \n   is listed as \"S. Miyahon,\" a mistranscription of his name — 本 can be read as either \"moto\" or \"hon.\"\n   This is widely believed to be another error in translation. However, in a leaked prototype of the game, many of the staff — including Miyamoto — were credited under their real names.\n   The pseudonym \"Miyahon\" was thus chosen deliberately for the final release.\n  \n\n\n    Completion Records\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Time\n     \n\n      Performer\n     \n\n      Date\n     \n\n      Notes\n     \n\n\n\n      Any%\n     \n\n      Schicksal\n     \n\n      27m 21s\n     \n\n      July 25, 2021\n     \n\n\n\n      Any%\n      \n       (All Glitches Except Up + A)\n      \n\n\n      Schicksal\n     \n\n      27m 54s\n     \n\n      January 6, 2021\n     \n\n\n\n      100%\n     \n\n      Schicksal\n     \n\n      34m 2s\n     \n\n      April 27, 2021\n     \n\n\n\n      100%\n      \n       (All Glitches Except Up + A)\n      \n\n\n      Greenmario\n     \n\n      35m 18s\n     \n\n      April 29, 2021\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Low%\n      \n\n\n      lackattack\n     \n\n      31m 31s\n     \n\n      May 14, 2019\n     \n\n\n\n      Sword\n      -less\n     \n\n      lackattack\n     \n\n      32m 26s\n     \n\n      May 12, 2019\n     \n\n\n\n      Extreme Rules\n     \n\n      lackattack\n     \n\n      1h 25m 24s\n     \n\n      September 27, 2015\n     \n\n\n\n      Any%\n      \n       (\n       Second Quest\n       )\n      \n\n\n      Eunos\n     \n\n      2m 19s\n     \n\n      February 3, 2021\n     \n\n\n\n      Any%\n      \n       (\n       \n        Second Quest\n       \n       , No ACE)\n      \n\n\n      Schicksal\n     \n\n      30m 38s\n     \n\n      May 26, 2021\n     \n\n\n\n      Any%\n      \n       (\n       \n        Second Quest\n       \n       , No ACE or Up + A Glitch)\n      \n\n\n      Schicksal\n     \n\n      33m 50s\n     \n\n      February 19, 2020\n     \n\n\n\n      100%\n      \n       (\n       \n        Second Quest\n       \n       )\n      \n\n\n      Schicksal\n     \n\n      41m 38s\n     \n\n      March 14, 2020\n     \n\n\n\n      Low%\n      \n       (\n       \n        Second Quest\n       \n       )\n      \n\n\n      Antlerz\n     \n\n      42m 30s\n     \n\n      October 16, 2020\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Sword\n      \n      -less\n      \n       (\n       \n        Second Quest\n       \n       )\n      \n\n\n      Saver\n     \n\n      37m 19s\n     \n\n      June 9, 2019\n     \n\n\n\n      Extreme Rules\n      \n       (\n       \n        Second Quest\n       \n       )\n      \n\n\n      Eunos\n     \n\n      2h 2m 53s\n     \n\n      February 25, 2016\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n    Listings\n   \n\n\n\n    Characters\n   \n\n\n\n    Bosses\n   \n\n\n\n    Enemies\n   \n\n\n\n    Dungeons\n   \n\n\n\n    Items\n   \n\n\n\n    Credits\n   \n\n\n\n    Glitches\n   \n\n\n\n    Reception\n   \n\n\n\n    Sales\n   \n\n\n\n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   was commercially successful, selling a million copies nearly a year after its release,\n   and cumulating a total of 6.5 million copies worldwide, making it the fourth best-selling\n   Nintendo Entertainment System\n   game of all time.\n  \n\n\n    Reviews\n   \n\n\n   IGN journalist Craig Harris awarded the\n   Game Boy Advance\n   version of the game with an 8.0 out of 10, praising its faithful adaptation from the original version;\n   Damien McFerran from Nintendolife gave the Virtual Console version (Wii) the same score, praising the length and the complexity of the quest.\n   Nintendojo staff, when reviewing the GCN edition (\n   \n\n     Collector's Edition\n    \n\n   ) praised the game for its \"innovative and unique gameplay system, remarkably deep puzzle solving, and an epic score\".\n   Nintendo Power, in the December 2009 issue, placed the game\n   \n    third\n   \n   in the list of best\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   games, citing its influence on gaming industry and praising its gameplay.\n  \n\n\n    Fan Reception\n   \n\n\n   The game received support from the player community as well. It currently holds an average user score of 9.1 at GameSpot,\n   as well as a current average reader score of 9.1 at IGN.\n  \n\n\n    Ports and Remakes\n   \n\n\n   A remake of the original game,\n   \n\n     BS The Legend of Zelda\n    \n\n   , was broadcast via the\n   BS-X Broadcasting System\n   . The gameplay is similar to the original, but differs as the game's central heroes are the\n   mascot characters\n   of the BS-X Broadcasting System, who are otherwise supposed to be based on the player as the character's name and gender is associated with the broadcasting ID. Aside from the initial green tunic, the male character wears a backwards baseball cap, and the female character has long red hair.\n  \n\n   In 2003, Nintendo released a bundle for the\n   Nintendo GameCube\n   which included the\n   \n\n     Collector's Edition\n    \n\n   , in which\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   is playable. This version notably provided a different and more accurate translation of the game script, which was used in most subsequent ports of the game.\n   It also included a few other changes, such as reduced screen flashing.\n  \n\n\n\n     Animal Crossing\n    \n\n   , also released in 2003, includes a number of emulated NES games as furniture pieces, though some are inaccessible without a cheating device.\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   is one such unobtainable game.\n  \n\n\n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   saw a port on the\n   Game Boy Advance\n   as part of the \"Classic NES Series\" re-releases in 2004.\n  \n\n   Ports of\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   were released on the Virtual Console service for the\n   \n    Wii\n   \n   ,\n   Nintendo 3DS\n   , and the\n   \n    Wii U\n   \n   . The Wii Virtual Console port was released in 2006 in most regions, releasing alongside the launch of the service. The 3DS Virutual port was initially available on August 31, 2011, as one of the games eligible for free download as part of the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Program, a service available to players who bought a 3DS before its price dropped on August 11, 2011.\n   It was later released to the public in 2012 in most regions. The Wii U Virtual Console port was released in 2013. Nearly all Virtual Console ports uses the updated changes from the 2003\n   \n    Collector's Edition\n   \n   version, with the exception of the 3DS Virtual Console port, which instead uses the original game's script.\n  \n\n\n\n     Super Smash Bros. Brawl\n    \n\n   features a number of timed, short demos of classic games, called \"Masterpieces\", in which players may only play up to a certain number of minutes depending on the game.\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   is offered as one of the Masterpieces, and is limited to two minutes of gameplay time. It returns as part of the Masterpieces library of\n   \n\n     Super Smash Bros. for Wii U\n    \n\n   ,  where the playtime for the demo has been doubled to four minutes.\n  \n\n   The\n   \n    NES Classic Edition\n   \n   includes\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   as one of the 30 games available.\n  \n\n\n    The Nintendo Entertainment System - Nintendo Switch Online\n   \n   software, available to Nintendo Switch Online Subscribers, included\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   as one of its 20 launch titles. Later on during the platform's life, a \"special save data\" for the game was introduced, titled \"The Legend of Zelda™ Living the life of luxury!\", that starts the game with more items and rupees in the players' possession.\n  \n\n\n    Legacy\n   \n\n\n\n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   is the first installment in the\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   franchise, and its success allowed the development of sequels. In one or another way, nearly every title in the series is influenced by this game in such ways as:\n  \n\n\n    The distinction between an overworld and a dungeon, as well as the need of traveling across the former to enter the latter, and to clear the latter to take a further step to the game's completion.\n   \n\n    The use of items to progress on the adventure, be it to beat enemies more easily or to open new ways and solve puzzles.\n   \n\n    The introduction of Link, Princess Zelda and Ganon.\n   \n\n    The introduction of the first two fragments of the\n    \n     Triforce\n    \n    .\n   \n\n    The introduction of a number of recurring locations (e.g.\n    \n     Lost Woods\n    \n    and\n    \n     Death Mountain\n    \n    ) and items.\n   \n\n    The presence of a\n    \n     Second Quest\n    \n    (although very few subsequent games reused this concept).\n   \n\n\n   The\n   \n    Moblin\n   \n   's quote\n   \"It's a secret to everybody\"\n   has become a popular\n   \n    meme\n   \n   among gamers over the years. It is first referenced in\n   \n\n     A Link to the Past\n    \n\n   when Link brings a chest to a man who stands next to a sign outside of the desert. He offers to open the chest under the condition that Link will \"keep it secret from everyone else\". It is also referenced in\n   \n\n     Ocarina of Time\n    \n\n   . If Link bribes the guard at the gate of Hyrule Castle, speaking after he opens the gate will result in him saying \"KEEP IT A SECRET TO EVERYBODY.\" And in\n   \n\n     Majora's Mask\n    \n\n   , after talking to Kafei in his home behind the\n   \n    Curiosity Shop\n   \n   , he says \"Keep what we just talked about a secret from everybody\". It is even referenced in\n   \n\n     Twilight Princess\n    \n\n   when in\n   \n    Center Castle Town\n   \n   , Link can enter a door and walk up to a balcony, where a\n   \n    Goron\n   \n   sees the golden force around\n   \n    Hyrule Castle\n   \n   . He admits that he has kept it \"a secret to everybody.\"\n  \n\n   The title theme for the game would later be used for the main theme of the game\n   \n\n     Hyrule Warriors\n    \n\n   , with bars from it also being used in the track \"Eclipse of the World\".\n  \n\n\n    Trivia\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The Hyrule Fantasy\n    \n    was used as a subtitle for the Japanese version of\n    \n     The Legend of Zelda\n    \n    ; however, this was dropped in subsequent games as adding a third subtitle (such as\n    \n     A Link to the Past\n    \n    ) would have made the title too long. This choice was also made to avoid comparisons with\n    \n\n      Final Fantasy\n     \n\n    .\n   \n\n    During development of the game, a rearrangement of\n    \n     Maurice Ravel\n    \n    's\n    \n     Boléro\n    \n    by\n    \n     Koji Kondo\n    \n    was used as the title theme. However, shortly before finishing the game, the developers learned that the song was still under copyright. Since they could not delay the release of the Disk System and the game itself, Kondo wrote the actual title theme in a single night.\n   \n\n    Most\n    \n     The Legend of Zelda\n    \n    cartridges are gold, but the Classic Series version of the game came in standard grey cartridges.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Names in Other Regions\n     \n\n\n\n      Language\n     \n\n      Name\n     \n\n      Meaning\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Japanese\n      \n\n\n\n       THE HYRULE FANTASY ゼルダの伝説\n      \n\n       ゼルダの伝説\n      \n\n\n      The Hyrule Fantasy: The Legend of Zelda\n      The Legend of Zelda\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Chinese\n      \n\n\n\n       塞尔达传说\n      \n\n\n      Zelda Legend\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Chinese\n      \n\n\n\n       薩爾達傳說\n      \n\n\n      Zelda Legend\n     \n\n\n\n\n       German\n      \n\n\n      The Legend of Zelda\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Korean\n      \n\n\n\n       젤다의 전설\n      \n\n\n      The Legend of Zelda\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      This article is a short summary of Eiji Aonuma.\n      NintendoWiki features\n      \n       a more in-depth article\n      \n      .\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Eiji Aonuma\n      青沼 英二\n      あおぬま えいじ\n     \n\n\n\n      Current Position\n     \n\n\n       Producer of\n       \n\n         The Legend of Zelda\n        \n        series\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n      Gender\n     \n\n\n       Male\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Birthday\n     \n\n\n       March 16, 1963\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Birthplace\n     \n\n\n       Nagano Prefecture, Japan\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Eiji Aonuma\n   \n   is a video game designer, director, and producer.

She is always either a child, teen, or young adult. Her hair color is depicted as blonde in most games of the series, as well as brown in\n   \n\n     Twilight Princess\n    \n\n   and red in\n   \n\n     The Legend of Zelda\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     The Adventure of Link\n    \n\n   . Her eyes are portrayed in different shades of blue throughout all the games, with the exception of her green eyes in\n   \n\n     Breath of the Wild\n    \n\n   . Her ears are always pointed, as is characteristic of all\n   \n    Hylians\n   \n   , although in some games her ears are shorter than in others. The dresses that she wears are long with determinate colors, such as different tones of pink, white, and blue. Most of her dresses are shown with the\n   Hylian Crest\n   , and in almost every game, she is seen wearing a tiara with either a red, pink, or blue jewel in it. In some games, she also wears long gloves. Princess Zelda is seen wearing makeup in most games, such as in\n   \n\n     The Wind Waker\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Spirit Tracks\n    \n\n   , and her hairstyle is characterized either with her hair down or with braids. She wears high heels, although in\n   \n    Twilight Princess\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Skyward Sword\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Breath of the Wild\n   \n   she wears boots. She also occasionally wears sandals, such as in\n   \n    Skyward Sword\n   \n   and\n   \n    Breath of the Wild\n   \n   . Each incarnation of Zelda has been shown at various ages depending on which title they appear in. They have appeared as a child, a teenager and as a young adult; for example, the Princess Zelda in\n   \n\n     Twilight Princess\n    \n\n   is around 20 years of age.\n  \n\n\n    Personality\n   \n\n\n   Zelda is depicted as a kind and benevolent ruler with a wisdom beyond her years and a deep love towards the people she watches over. She is a caring, gracious, and self-sacrificing person.\n   Zelda's most prominent display of compassion and selflessness was when she saved the life of\n   \n    Midna\n   \n   , the Princess of the\n   \n    Twilight Realm\n   \n   , who had been nearly killed by the false King of the Twilight,\n   \n    Zant\n   \n   .\n   Zelda's wisdom is her most valuable attribute. As a matriarch, it is imperative that she makes the wisest decision concerning the fate of Hyrule; in\n   \n\n     Twilight Princess\n    \n\n   when Zant threatened her life and the lives of all of her subjects, she wisely surrendered to him.\n   She upholds her responsibilities no matter the cost and is always willing to help her friends, such as in\n   \n\n     Skyward Sword\n    \n\n   , where Zelda faces her duties as the goddess reborn and willingly remains in a deep sleep to keep\n   \n    Demise\n   \n   imprisoned within his seal.\n   Above all, Zelda is known to be a forgiving person even towards those who have harmed her before, as seen in\n   \n\n     Spirit Tracks\n    \n\n   , where she asks\n   \n    Anjean\n   \n   to take care of\n   Byrne\n   even though he was the one who stole her body.\n  \n\n   Princess Zelda is one of the three most important characters of\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   series, which is also why her name appears in the title of every game. Princess Zelda first appeared in the original\n   \n\n     The Legend of Zelda\n    \n\n   , and has since been featured in every subsequent game, with the exception of\n   \n\n     Link's Awakening\n    \n\n   . Each incarnation of the Princess is chosen by destiny to be the keeper of the Triforce of Wisdom in their respective eras, which is the main reason why they play such an integral role in the legends of Hyrule.\n  \n\n   by the way, In Game Book \"\n   Battle of Mirage Castle\n   \", it is nighttime and you will take the place of Link who is trapped in the Crystal Moon, but only Link can enter the Mirage Castle.\n  \n\n\n    Abilities\n   \n\n\n   Throughout the series, Princess Zelda portrays various types of both magical and physical abilities, ranging from capably wielding a bow\n   to telepathy, as seen in\n   \n    A Link to the Past'\n   \n   s introduction when she pleads for Link's help.\n  \n\n   Early on in the\n   \n    timeline of the series\n   \n   , the original Zelda, while born as a Hylian, is the mortal incarnation of the\n   \n    Goddess Hylia\n   \n   .\n   Carrying on this divine blood, her female descendants are always the\n   \n    crown princess\n   \n   of\n   \n    Hyrule\n   \n   throughout its history.\n   Several princesses within the bloodline are also the possessor of the\n   \n    Triforce of Wisdom\n   \n   , imbued with the essence of the Goddess\n   Nayru\n   .\n   The essence of Nayru affords each Zelda divine wisdom, allowing them to discern the wisest decisions, especially in situations concerning the welfare of Hyrule. It grants them myriad mystical abilities, including the ability to heal others, though there is a possibility that this could also be an effect of their bloodline passing down Hylia's own powers and, later, the\n   \n    Light Force\n   \n   . Each incarnation of Zelda uses their powers to keep evil in check.\n  \n\n   Many of her abilities as both a Sage and the wielder of the Triforce of Wisdom are widely illustrated in\n   \n    Ocarina of Time\n   \n   , one of them being that she has prophetic visions in her dreams.\n   She also helps Link in their escape from\n   \n    Ganon's Castle\n   \n   by using her powers to magically remove the barriers blocking the exits. During the final battle between Link and Ganon, Princess Zelda uses her powers to restrain the King of Evil as Link delivers the final blow.\n   Being the seventh\n   \n    Sage\n   \n   , she is the ruler of the rest of the six Sages, and it is with her guidance that the Sages seal Ganon in the void of the\n   Evil Realm\n   .\n   Finally, with her powers as a Sage, she is capable of returning Link to his original time by simply using the\n   \n    Ocarina of Time\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Some of Princess Zelda's physical abilities are demonstrated in games such as\n   \n\n     The Wind Waker\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n\n     Twilight Princess\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Spirit Tracks\n    \n\n   . In\n   \n    The Wind Waker\n   \n   , Princess Zelda aids Link in battling Ganondorf by borrowing the young hero's bow and using it to fire\n   Light Arrows\n   at the King of the Gerudo.\n   This skill is again portrayed in the final battle of\n   \n    Twilight Princess\n   \n   , where the princess yet again uses a bow and Light Arrows to strike Ganondorf while accompanying Link on his horse,\n   and once more in the final battle against\n   \n    Malladus\n   \n   in\n   \n    Spirit Tracks\n   \n   . In one scene of\n   \n    Twilight Princess\n   \n   , Princess Zelda is seen wielding a sword, although it is unknown if she possesses any true sword skills.\n  \n\n   As shown in\n   \n    Twilight Princess\n   \n   , Princess Zelda is capable of communicating with the\n   Light Spirits\n   . Just as the princess and Link are about to be trampled by Ganondorf's ghostly army, Zelda calls upon the Light Spirits to aid her in her time of need, and the spirits grant her the Light Arrow to banish evil.\n  \n\n   In\n   \n    Spirit Tracks\n   \n   , Princess Zelda can possess a\n   Phantom\n   's body after Link strikes it with a powered-up sword or the\n   Lokomo Sword\n   . While in this state, the princess can help Link solve various puzzles as well as cross certain obstacles that the young hero cannot traverse by himself.\n   Moreover, due to the Phantom's armor, she can also protect Link from attacks or use her strength to fight alongside Link and help him defeat enemies, as seen when fighting\n   Geozards\n   or\n   Byrne\n   .\n  \n\n   In the Game Book \"Battle of Mirage Castle\", it has the same abilities as Link.\n  \n\n\n    Naming Tradition and Law\n   \n\n\n\n    Origin\n   \n\n\n   It was revealed by\n   \n\n     Hyrule Historia\n    \n\n   that when the kingdom of Hyrule was established during the\n   Era of Prosperity\n   , the daughters of the Royal Family were often named Zelda after their ancestor, the\n   mortal incarnation of the Goddess Hylia\n   , from the events of\n   \n    Skyward Sword\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    The Tragedy of \"Princess Zelda I\"\n   \n\n\n   While she was not the first Princess Zelda in the history of Hyrule, she was the first in a long line of princesses to be named Zelda by law and not tradition after she was put into a deep sleep for many generations. Her brother, the\n   \n    Prince of Hyrule\n   \n   at the end of its\n   Golden Era\n   , who was partly to blame for her comatose state, decided that, in honor of his sister, every princess born into the\n   \n    Royal Family of Hyrule\n   \n   should be named Zelda.\n  \n\n\n    Unified Timeline\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Skyward Sword\n    \n\n\n\n   The Zelda in\n   \n\n     Skyward Sword\n    \n\n   is the eleventh Zelda appearing in the\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   series, and is currently the earliest incarnation of Zelda chronologically to appear in-game.\n  \n\n   In\n   \n    Skyward Sword\n   \n   , Zelda, daughter of\n   Gaepora\n   , lives in\n   \n    Skyloft\n   \n   with her childhood friend\n   \n    Link\n   \n   ,\n   where they are both students at the\n   Knight Academy\n   .\n   After playing the role of the\n   \n    goddess\n   \n   at the\n   \n    Wing Ceremony\n   \n   , Link and Zelda go for a flight together, when suddenly a twister pulls Zelda and her\n   \n    Loftwing\n   \n   below the clouds. This phenomenon is later revealed to have been caused by\n   \n    Ghirahim\n   \n   , who needs Zelda's soul to resurrect\n   \n    Demise\n   \n   , his master.\n   Upon Zelda's arrival on\n   \n    the Surface\n   \n   , however, she is rescued by\n   \n    Impa\n   \n   before the Demon Lord can capture her.\n   Link then begins to look for Zelda and eventually finds her in the\n   Earth Spring\n   , but Impa impedes him from reaching the young girl,\n   and instead urges Zelda to continue praying at each goddess statue to finish purifying her body.\n  \n\n   Eventually, Link catches up with Zelda and Impa at the\n   \n    Temple of Time\n   \n   , but their reunion is cut short when Ghirahim attacks the duo. In the midst of the frenetic action, Zelda gives Link the\n   \n    Goddess's Harp\n   \n   before she and Impa escape through the\n   \n    Gate of Time\n   \n   , with Impa destroying the gate to escape Ghirahim's grasp. Link manages to activate a second Gate of Time and meets with Zelda, who explains her true nature as the mortal reincarnation of the Goddess Hylia before telling Link that she,\n   as Hylia reborn, must remain in a deep sleep to keep Demise imprisoned within his seal.\n   Before doing so, Zelda explains that the goddess needed someone with an \"unbreakable spirit\" to defeat Demise.\n   However, Hylia, knowing that the young hero would \"throw [himself] headfirst into any danger, without even a moment's doubt\" if it meant saving Zelda,\n   used Link to try and bring about the destruction of Demise. She proceeds to seal herself into a crystal and sleep for thousands of years to ensure Demise's seal holds, and tells Link that he must find and use the Triforce to destroy Demise so that she will be able to wake up in their own time.\n  \n\n   Although Link uses the\n   \n    Triforce\n   \n   to wish for Demise's destruction,\n   \n    Ghirahim\n   \n   kidnaps Zelda upon her awakening and takes her through the Gate of Time, where Demise is still sealed.\n   Zelda's soul is absorbed and Demise is revived in his true form,\n   but Link manages to defeat the Demon King and seal his remains in the\n   \n    Master Sword\n   \n   . After her soul is restored, Zelda and the young hero return to their own time, where she mentions to Link that she wants to remain in the surface and watch over the Triforce. Zelda asks what Link's intentions are for the future,\n   and Link smiles at her, with the camera panning to show both his and Zelda's Loftwings flying back into the sky, implying that Link chose to stay with Zelda.\n  \n\n   This incarnation of Zelda is unique in that she is not a princess during the course of the game's events.\n  \n\n\n\n     Fi\n    \n    's Comment:\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n         Target Lock:\n        \n\n         Zelda\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n       This is\n       \n        Zelda\n       \n       , your childhood friend.

One day, she sensed something unusual at the Four Sword Shrine and took Link to accompany her to investigate.\n   The seal on Vaati at the shrine had weakened, allowing Vaati to escape. Vaati kidnapped Princess Zelda to make her his bride and Link drew the Four Sword to save her.\n  \n\n\n\n     Ocarina of Time\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n     Young Zelda as she appears in\n     \n      Ocarina of Time\n     \n\n\n\n\n   The Zelda in\n   \n\n     Ocarina of Time\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Majora's Mask\n    \n\n   is the fourth Zelda appearing in the\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   series, and the fourth Zelda chronologically.\n  \n\n   Growing up in the halls of Hyrule Castle, young Princess Zelda, referred to by the\n   Great Deku Tree\n   as the Princess of Destiny,\n   was growing concerned with one of her father's associates, the\n   \n    Gerudo\n   \n   king\n   \n    Ganondorf\n   \n   , and a vision of his treachery did not help matters.\n   Expressing her concerns with her guardian and nursemaid Impa, she continued to watch the Gerudo despite her inability to do anything about him. This changed when a young\n   \n    Kokiri\n   \n   boy named Link snuck into her garden courtyard.\n  \n\n   Convinced that Ganondorf was after the Triforce, Zelda asked Link to find the three Spiritual Stones that would open the\n   \n    Temple of Time\n   \n   in order to prevent Ganondorf from opening the Door of Time and claiming the Triforce for himself.\n   Unfortunately, Ganondorf made his move before Link could return, leading an insurrection in the castle. He chased after Zelda, who had the\n   \n    Ocarina of Time\n   \n   in her possession, when Impa escaped with her from the castle. Dashing out of the castle town with Ganondorf in hot pursuit, Zelda caught sight of Link diving out of their way. She turned and threw the Ocarina of Time to him, trusting that he would keep it safe while Ganondorf chased after them.\n  \n\n   For seven years Zelda remained in hiding, training in the ways of the\n   \n    Sheikah\n   \n   by Impa until Link, who had become trapped within the\n   \n    Sacred Realm\n   \n   , was freed. Appearing before him under the name of\n   \n    Sheik\n   \n   , she assisted Link in awakening the remaining five\n   \n    Sages\n   \n   ,\n   all the while keeping her real identity secret.\n  \n\n   When Zelda finally reveals herself, she does so not only as Princess Zelda but as the seventh sage, the leader of the other Sages, and wielder of the Triforce of Wisdom;\n   however, having  watched them from afar, Ganondorf captures Zelda to drive Link into a fight to the death inside his castle.\n  \n\n   In the game's conclusion, Zelda sends Link, the Hero of Time, back to his childhood to regain his lost seven years as compensation for his role in the war against Ganondorf.\n   This would leave only the Hero of Time's legend behind him as he returned to the past and returned to Hyrule Castle to warn the young Princess Zelda of events to come.\n  \n\n   The actions made by this incarnation of Princess Zelda were crucial to the development of the\n   \n    Zelda Timeline\n   \n   , since it was through Zelda's choices that three timelines were eventually created, making her instrumental in the history of Hyrule. Her plot with Link to retrieve the Triforce resulted in Ganondorf obtaining the Triforce of Power,\n   eventually leading to Ganondorf besting Link in the final battle, and thus forming the\n   Fallen Hero Timeline\n   .\n   Should Link succeed in defeating Ganondorf, sending Link back to his own time afterwards created two timelines: the\n   Child Timeline\n   and the\n   Adult Timeline\n   . The latter of the two shatters the Triforce of Courage and vanquishes the hero in the Adult Timeline,\n   resulting in Hyrule eventually\n   \n    being flooded\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Fallen Hero Timeline\n   \n\n\n   The Fallen Hero Timeline is the timeline in which Link, the Hero of Time, despite his best efforts, was defeated by Ganondorf in the final battle.

One day, she witnesses a mysterious and brilliant light in the sky to the east. Aginah, the younger brother of the wise man Sahasrahla and now living in his old hideout near the Eastern Palace also witnesses such a light, and travels to investigate. There he finds a strange youth lying on the ground. Zelda, also following the light, meets up with Aginah, and they both carry the child to rest in Sahasrahla's hideout. Confused by the youth's unusual clothes, they believe the child not to hail from Kakariko Village. Speaking to Aginah while the youngster sleeps, Zelda learns that his brother Sahasrahla had also sensed danger surrounding Hyrule and had left the land to find the hero, Link. While Link has not yet returned, Zelda senses that if this new youth was endowed with courage, he or she may be the Hero of Light. Zelda then sets of for Hyrule Castle before sending Aginah to find the Book of Mudora while she speaks to the Fortune Teller. Aginah and the hero travel to the Sanctuary at the foot of the mountain, but Zelda follows, claiming she had another prophetic dream, this time of her holding the Book of Mudora on top of Death Mountain. Zelda insists on traveling with the hero to the summit of the mountain, as she is the only one who can read the Book of Mudora. During their quest to obtain the final two tablets and reach the summit, the Fortune Teller sees the King of Evil in a vision. Ganon's malice had kept his spirit alive despite the destruction of his body. It was this lingering evil power that had drawn the Hero of Light into the land of Hyrule, and upon the summit the hero travels once more into another world to engage in a desperate final battle with the Demon King in a new version of Ganon's Tower. Ganon desires the power of the Hero of Light to be fully reborn, but is finally destroyed using the Silver Arrows once more.\n   \n\n\n\n\n     A Link Between Worlds\n    \n\n\n\n\n   The Zelda in\n   \n\n     A Link Between Worlds\n    \n\n   is the twelfth Zelda in the\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   series, and the second Zelda chronologically in the Fallen Hero Timeline.\n  \n\n   Zelda appears again in\n   \n\n     A Link Between Worlds\n    \n\n   .

She tells the young hero to warn Sahasrahla in Kakariko Village and gives Link a charm that she has owned since childhood. When Hyrule Castle is under Yuga's attack, Link learns that the charm she gave is the Pendant of Courage, which she gave to him in anticipation of the oncoming misfortune.\n  \n\n   When Link goes\n   Inside Hyrule Castle\n   , he encounters a confrontation between Zelda and Yuga. Zelda tells Yuga that his actions must cease and asks him how many more people he intends to kidnap,\n    to which Yuga says he has been searching for all seven Sages of Hyrule.\n    Zelda then accuses him of attempting to use the Seven Sages to revive Ganon,\n    but Yuga ignores her and turns her into a Painting for her beauty.\n    He then takes her Painting to the highest point of Hyrule Castle and escapes to\n   \n    Lorule\n   \n   . In Lorule, he uses the power of the Seven Sages and Princess Zelda to revive Ganon and merges with Ganon before all the Paintings, save Zelda's, are scattered across Lorule. After Link frees the sages and assembles the Triforce, he and Zelda use it to restore the\n   Lorulean Triforce\n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     The Legend of Zelda\n    \n\n\n\n   The Zelda in\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   is the first Zelda appearing in the\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   series, and the fourth Zelda chronologically in the Fallen Hero Timeline.\n  \n\n   An army of evil, led by\n   Ganon\n   , seeks to possess the\n   Triforce\n   to plunge the land of Hyrule into darkness.\n    Stealing the Triforce of Power, Ganon sought to find the last known piece, the Triforce of Wisdom.\n  \n\n   Princess Zelda, as a member of the bloodline that carries and protects the Triforce of Wisdom, broke the Triforce piece into eight fragments and hid them throughout the realm in an effort to avoid its possession under Ganon's hand.\n    At the same time, she sent out her handmaiden,\n   Impa\n   , to look for a hero to save the land.\n    Ganon learned of what Zelda had done and imprisoned her within his lair under\n   Death Mountain\n   , surrounded by a wall of flame.\n  \n\n   Link eventually finds the eight\n   fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom\n   scattered throughout Hyrule and travels to Death Mountain where, upon defeating Ganon, he frees Zelda from her prison, returning peace to the land.\n  \n\n\n\n     The Adventure of Link\n    \n\n\n\n   The Zelda in\n   \n    The Adventure of Link\n   \n   is the second Zelda appearing in the\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   series.\n  \n\n   The introduction of\n   \n\n     The Adventure of Link\n    \n\n   speaks of the legend of Zelda, a legend that has been passed down in Hyrule.\n    According to that legend, well before the events of\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   , Hyrule was a prosperous land ruled by a\n   \n    king\n   \n   who had two children, an\n   \n    unnamed prince\n   \n   and Princess Zelda. The King maintained peace in Hyrule using the Triforce; however, he passed away, and although the prince should have received the Triforce in full, he only received a part of it.\n    The prince frantically searched in vain everywhere for the remaining piece, but then a\n   \n    wizard\n   \n   came to the Prince and tells him that his younger sister, Zelda, knows the location of the mystical object.\n    The prince demands that Zelda turn the information over to him, but Zelda refuses and, in a rage, the wizard puts Zelda into an eternal sleep, with him dying in the process.\n    Overcome with grief, the prince seals his sleeping sister in the\n   \n    North Palace\n   \n   and orders that all female descendants of the Hylian monarchy are to be named Zelda.\n  \n\n   To break the curse, a hero must possess the complete Triforce, but obtaining the\n   \n    Triforce of Courage\n   \n   would prove difficult as the king of ages ago had hidden it within the\n   \n    Great Palace\n   \n   .\n    Only one who proved themselves worthy would obtain it.\n  \n\n   In the end, Link obtains the Triforce of Courage from the Great Palace and awakes the sleeping princess from her slumber.\n  \n\n   This Zelda is a different one from the original\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   even though both games feature the same Link.\n  \n\n\n\n     Zelda\n    \n    (Game & Watch)\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ambiguously Canon Content\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Princess Zelda was kidnapped by the\n    Eight Dragons\n    in order to cause chaos in Hyrule. She is imprisoned in a magical cage that can only be opened with the pieces of the\n    \n     Triforce\n    \n    of Wisdom. Link journeys through the dungeon, defeats the dragons and saves Zelda.\n   \n\n\n\n    Child Timeline\n   \n\n\n   The Child Timeline is the timeline that follows Link after being sent back to his original time to warn Princess Zelda, following the defeat of Ganondorf by the Hero of Time in the final battle. This turn of events created the timeline containing\n   \n    Majora's Mask\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Twilight Princess\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Four Swords Adventures\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Majora's Mask\n    \n\n\n\n   Prior the events of\n   \n\n     Majora's Mask\n    \n\n   , Zelda spends a relatively short period of time with Link, before he leaves\n   \n    Hyrule\n   \n   for his quest in search of his companion\n   Navi\n   .\n    Zelda, as a child, makes a single appearance in\n   \n\n     Majora's Mask\n    \n\n   when Link has a flashback after retrieving the Ocarina of Time from the\n   Skull Kid\n   . The events of the flashback display Link's last meeting with Zelda, where she states her belief that they would meet again.\n    However, before Link departs the land of\n   \n    Hyrule\n   \n   , Princess Zelda gives him the Ocarina of Time to prevent Ganondorf from entering the Sacred Realm and as a memento of the time they spent together.\n    She also teaches Link the \"\n   \n    Song of Time\n   \n   \", a melody that holds a special meaning to her,\n    before handing over the ocarina, mentioning that he should play that melody if something were to happen to him so the\n   Goddess of Time\n   will come to his aid.\n  \n\n\n    (This Zelda is the same one from\n    \n\n      Ocarina of Time\n     \n\n    )\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Twilight Princess\n    \n\n\n\n   The Zelda in\n   \n    Twilight Princess\n   \n   is the ninth Zelda appearing in the\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   series, and the second Zelda chronologically in the Child Timeline branch.\n  \n\n   In\n   \n\n     Twilight Princess\n    \n\n   , Zelda was the young matriarch of Hyrule until its\n   invasion\n   by\n   \n    Zant\n   \n   , the Twilight King, to whom she surrendered in order to prevent the deaths of herself and her people.\n    Afterward, she is imprisoned inside a tower in Hyrule Castle. It is revealed that Zelda is unaffected by the veil of\n   \n    Twilight\n   \n   Zant casts upon Hyrule and does not become a\n   \n    spirit\n   \n   like all the other inhabitants of the kingdom. As the bearer of the\n   \n    Triforce of Wisdom\n   \n   , Zelda may have been protected by its power.\n  \n\n   Zelda, dressed in a dark robe, meets Link during his earliest transformation into a wolf (due to the interaction between the Twilight and his Triforce piece). Later, she transfers her soul and her powers to aid the dying\n   \n    Midna\n   \n   , losing her physical being in the process.\n  \n\n   Towards the end of the game, Ganondorf possesses the lifeless Zelda, who was being imprisoned in the throne room of Hyrule Castle, transforming her into an enemy known as\n   Puppet Zelda\n   . Link defeats Ganondorf's puppet, and Midna, with the help of the Fused Shadows, returns Princess Zelda to normal.\n  \n\n   Ganondorf makes another attempt on Zelda's life soon after, but she is protected by the\n   Light Spirits\n   of Hyrule who grant her the\n   Light Arrows\n   to assist Link in the horseback part of his final battle.\n    The last time she is seen in the game is when she and Link say good-bye to Midna at the\n   \n    Mirror of Twilight\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Four Swords Adventures\n    \n\n\n\n   The Zelda in\n   \n\n     Four Swords Adventures\n    \n\n   is the seventh Zelda appearing in the\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   series, and the third Zelda chronologically in the Child Timeline branch.\n  \n\n   In\n   \n\n     Four Swords Adventures\n    \n\n   , Zelda used her telepathy to call Link to Hyrule Castle so she and him can join the\n   \n    Shrine Maidens\n   \n   to investigate the seal on\n   \n    Vaati\n   \n   at the\n   Four Sword Sanctuary\n   , due to ominous clouds of darkness covering Hyrule. However, while using their magic to check the seal,\n   \n    Shadow Link\n   \n   appeared and kidnapped Zelda and the six Maidens and sent Link to the Four Sword Sanctuary. This was all a trap by Shadow Link to cause Link to draw the Four Sword, releasing the seal on the Wind Mage Vaati, allowing him to escape.\n  \n\n   Once rescued from Vaati, Link and Zelda flee down the\n   Tower of Winds\n   , similar to the escape from\n   \n    Ganon's Tower\n   \n   in\n   \n    Ocarina of Time\n   \n   . Zelda must be protected from damage during this escape. When nearing the exit however, the four Links and Zelda are sent tumbling deep beneath the tower by Ganon. While the four Link's are out cold, Zelda attempts to seal away Ganon with her magic, but is instead stopped and sealed away by Ganon himself. The four Links fight Ganon together, and eventually weaken him enough to break the seal on Zelda. Zelda then fights Ganon alongside the Links much like in\n   \n\n     The Wind Waker\n    \n\n   . While she does not wield the Light Arrows by name, she does wield a ball of light energy which, coupled with Link's arrows, serves the same function of the Light Arrows, stunning Ganon long enough for him to be drawn into the\n   \n    Four Sword\n   \n   . She must be protected from Ganon's attacks so the ball of light energy can become big enough to contain Ganon's evil might.\n  \n\n\n    Adult Timeline\n   \n\n\n   The Adult Timeline is the timeline that follows the events after Link is being sent back to his original time, following the Hero of Time's defeat of Ganondorf in the final battle. Ganondorf is sealed within the\n   \n    Sacred Realm\n   \n   by the Seven Sages but, with Link sent back in time, the world is left without a Hero. This turn of events created the timeline containing\n   \n    The Wind Waker\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Phantom Hourglass\n   \n   , and\n   \n    Spirit Tracks\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     The Wind Waker\n    \n\n\n\n   The Zelda in\n   \n    The Wind Waker\n   \n   and\n   \n\n     Phantom Hourglass\n    \n\n   is the sixth Zelda appearing in the\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   series, and the first Zelda chronologically in the Adult Timeline branch.\n  \n\n\n\n     The Wind Waker\n    \n\n   presents Zelda in a secret identity as\n   \n    Tetra\n   \n   , a female pirate who leads a small group of thieves after the death of her mother.\n    Tetra, however, is even unaware herself of being part of the royal bloodline, and this is a first occurrence for\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   series.\n    Despite this, the female pirate is aware of the existence of Hyrule, the Master Sword, and the legend of the Hero of Time. Tetra's identity as a descendant of Princess Zelda is revealed when she travels with Link to Hyrule Castle, beneath the\n   \n    Great Sea\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   Her true identity was first hinted when Link travels to the\n   \n    Forsaken Fortress\n   \n   for a second time and encounters Ganondorf, who, as he grasps Tetra in his hand, realizes that his Triforce of Power is resonating, which could only indicate that Tetra is indeed the Princess Zelda.\n  \n\n   Zelda as Tetra displayed a tomboyish demeanor, taking challenges head on and even seeming bossy at times. At the beginning of the game, she does not think much of Link due to his habit of taking actions without thinking things through, and also due to the fact that he gets melancholic as they are setting sail to the Forsaken Fortress to rescue his sister.\n    Once Tetra discovers her true identity, she gains more respect towards the young hero, and apologizes for all that has happened to him and\n   \n    Aryll\n   \n   .\n    While Link and the\n   \n    King of Red Lions\n   \n   set out to look for the pieces of the Triforce of Courage, Zelda stays hidden away in a basement located inside Hyrule Castle in order to prevent getting caught by Ganondorf.\n    However, she is eventually found and is taken to Ganon's Tower, where Link must rescue her after assembling the Triforce of Courage.\n  \n\n   Zelda from\n   \n    The Wind Waker\n   \n   is the first Zelda in the series that fights along Link's side in his battle against Ganondorf. In battle, she wields the\n   \n    bow\n   \n   and\n   Light Arrows\n   , similar to her\n   \n    Twilight Princess\n   \n   counterpart.\n    Once Link and Zelda succeed in delivering the final blow, they witness the second flood of Hyrule and promise the\n   \n    King of Hyrule\n   \n   to search for the new land that will be home to the next kingdom of Hyrule.\n    Zelda is last seen as Tetra when she and Link set sail from\n   Outset Island\n   in search for new lands.\n  \n\n\n\n\n      Princess Zelda (\n      Figurine\n      from\n      \n\n        The Wind Waker\n       \n\n      )\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Princess Zelda\n      \n\n\n      Princess Zelda is the legitimate heir to the\n      \n       Hyrulean royal family\n      \n      . She is actually the pirate\n      \n       Tetra\n      \n      .\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Phantom Hourglass\n    \n\n\n\n   Princess Zelda appears in this game solely as Tetra, her alter ego in\n   \n\n     The Wind Waker\n    \n\n   . She does not regain her royal persona, although quite often when she appears, “\n   \n    Zelda's Lullaby\n   \n   ” plays in the background, and she is called \"Zelda\" by some of the pirates during the game's intro,\n    much to Tetra's chagrin.\n    Her role is somewhat limited in the game as she is kidnapped early on in the story, and when Link finds her at last she has been turned to stone.\n  \n\n   After Link defeats\n   Bellum\n   , he and Tetra awaken on the Ghost Ship, only ten minutes after the prologue according to the pirates.\n    Tetra's crew tries to convince her that it was just a dream, but Link finds the\n   Phantom Hourglass\n   in his pocket, and the\n   SS Linebeck\n   is seen sailing in the distance.\n  \n\n\n    (This Zelda is the same one from\n    \n\n      The Wind Waker\n     \n\n    )\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Spirit Tracks\n    \n\n\n\n   The Zelda in\n   \n\n     Spirit Tracks\n    \n\n   is the tenth Zelda appearing in the\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   series, and the second Zelda chronologically in the Adult Timeline branch.\n  \n\n   Princess Zelda plays a much larger role in\n   \n\n     Spirit Tracks\n    \n\n   than in previous installments, as she herself also aids Link in the salvation of Hyrule.  Near the beginning of the game, Link travels to\n   Hyrule Castle\n   to see Zelda and become an official train conductor. Because he is an engineer and the apprentice of\n   \n    Alfonzo\n   \n   , who was once the head of the castle guard, Zelda asks Link to secretly meet her in her quarters later to discuss something with him. Zelda explains to Link that she needs to get to the\n   \n    Tower of Spirits\n   \n   to personally investigate the disappearance of the\n   Spirit Tracks\n   , which she attributes to something that\n   Chancellor Cole\n   is hiding.\n  \n\n   For the first time (not counting the non-canonical Phillips CD-i games), it is possible to play as Zelda herself as Link aids the princess to escape the castle. Afterward, Link, Zelda, and\n   \n    Alfonzo\n   \n   attempt to escape via train, but the train crashes due to the\n   \n    tracks\n   \n   disappearing beneath them.\n   Chancellor Cole\n   then appears to attack Zelda and take her body, which he hopes to use to revive the Demon King\n   \n    Malladus\n   \n   ; however, Zelda's spirit escapes and returns to Hyrule Castle. There, she meets with Link, now the only one who can see her, to continue their way to the Tower of Spirits, where Zelda learns she can\n   inhabit Phantoms\n   to aid Link. After this, she and Link begin their journey to restore the Spirit Tracks leading to the Tower of Spirits to fortify the Malladus's prison and thus prevent the resurrection of the Demon King.\n  \n\n\n\n     Zelda as a ghost in\n     \n      Spirit Tracks\n     \n\n\n\n\n   Zelda's body is eventually possessed by the resurrected Malladus, although Link frees it by firing a\n   Light Arrow\n   . Despite this, Zelda is unable to reenter her body, and just as Malladus is about to possess it again, Byrne uses his power to repel the Demon King, giving Zelda the strength to pray to her grandmother Tetra to reclaim her body.\n    In the final battle, Zelda, finally back in her own body, charges up her power to weaken the Demon King, which reveals a weak spot on the demon's back.\n    Like in previous games, Princess Zelda's role consists of shooting Light Arrows at Malladus's back from the\n   Bow of Light\n   .\n    Just as Link realizes that he cannot make the final blow to Malladus using the\n   Lokomo Sword\n   on his own, Princess Zelda rushes over to help the young hero, defeating the demon once and for all.\n    Anjean and the rest of the Lokomos depart to the heavens, entrusting Link and Zelda to watch over the land for them.\n    Link and Zelda are then seen holding hands as they witness the departure of the Lokomos.\n  \n\n   After the ending credits, Princess Zelda can be seen at her office signing papers and, depending on whether Link chose to be an engineer or a warrior, she will go look out the window and wave at Link upon hearing either a train whistle or swords clanking. If Link selects \"Dunno\", then Zelda will be signing papers and simply remember the adventure she had with Link.\n  \n\n   This Princess Zelda is confirmed to be a direct descendant of\n   \n    Tetra\n   \n   ,\n    the pirate captain who was also the incarnation of Princess Zelda in her day, and makes an appearance in a large stained glass window in Hyrule Castle's Throne Room.\n    Princess Zelda states that the\n   \n    Spirit Flute\n   \n   was played for her in her youth by her grandmother, and Anjean states that she gave the Spirit Flute to Tetra long ago, pointing out the similarities between the reigning Princess Zelda and her ancestor, the feisty pirate captain that arrived on the land's shores long ago.\n  \n\n\n    Great Calamity\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Breath of the Wild\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n     Artwork of Zelda from\n     \n      The Champions' Ballad\n     \n\n\n\n\n   In\n   \n    Breath of the Wild\n   \n   , Zelda is not only the princess of Hyrule, she is also an aspiring scholar who is very curious.\n    She is also the leader of the\n   \n    Champions\n   \n   of Hyrule.\n    Zelda is the mysterious voice that guides Link throughout his journey while she contains Calamity Ganon inside of Hyrule Castle.\n  \n\n   Zelda has been training to unlock her sealing powers passed down the royal family since she was 7 years old, one year after her mother unexpectedly passed away. With her mother gone there was nobody else around with the sacred power who could teach her how to use it, leaving Zelda to figure it out on her own.\n    100 years prior to the events of\n   \n    Breath of the Wild\n   \n   , Zelda met with the Champions. After meeting with them, she left the Castle to research ancient technology, but she did not come across anything of note.\n    During this time, she felt the presence of Ganon and devoted herself to learning all she could about ancient relics in order to stop him.\n    She then met with a fortune teller who told her a prophecy, to which Zelda felt that there was not much time left.\n    The following day, Link was appointed as Zelda's knight, to Zelda's chagrin.\n    During the ceremony, Urbosa explains that Link is a living reminder of Zelda's own failures.\n    Link and Zelda then set out to\n   \n    Goron City\n   \n   to make adjustments to the\n   Divine Beast Vah Rudania\n   to make it easier for\n   Daruk\n   to control.\n    During their journey to\n   Eldin\n   , Zelda comes to a stop and asks him how proficient he is wielding his\n   \n    Sword\n   \n   and asks him if he can hear the voice within the blade.\n  \n\n   During her time with Link, Zelda wonders why he never speaks.\n    Link's initial silence causes Zelda to believe that Link despised her due to her inability to use sealing power despite being a daughter of Hyrule's royal family.\n    Later on, Zelda discovers an\n   \n    Ancient Shrine\n   \n   and fails to open it.\n    Link arrives at the scene, which angers Zelda and causes her to lash out.\n    She tells Link to return to the castle\n    and testily demands he stop following her, regardless of the\n   \n    King\n   \n   's orders.\n    Later on, Zelda travels to the\n   \n    Gerudo Desert\n   \n   and is ambushed by the\n   Yiga Clan\n   . Link rescues her right before a\n   Yiga assassin\n   is about to kill her, striking him down and causing the other two Yiga to flee. This causes Zelda to change her attitude towards Link, valuing his devotion to protect her.\n    Over the course of their journey, both start to open up to each other and realize how similar they are in their hardships of fulfilling their respective tasks.\n    Her growing care and relationship towards Link plays a crucial role in awakening her\n   \n    legendary abilities\n   \n   , as Link sacrifices himself to save Zelda's life during the\n   second Great Calamity\n   and Zelda's powers awaken when she tries to rescue the wounded Link from a Guardian.\n    Zelda then spends the next 100 years inside Hyrule Castle with Calamity Ganon, keeping the demon in place within the Castle to prevent the destruction of the entirety of Hyrule. After Link awakens, she then telepathically guides him throughout his journey. Unfortunately, she was not able to hold off Calamity Ganon for much longer before he developed a rudimentary body. After Link managed to disable Calamity Ganon's most powerful form, Dark Beast Ganon, she was freed, and proceeded to destroy Calamity Ganon's essence. She then reconvened with Link for the first time in a hundred years, and asked him if he still remembered her (as Link was initially left with amnesia thanks to his near-death experience). Some time later, she alongside Link left for Lake Hylia in order to investigate what caused the Divine Beast Vah Ruta to stop working, and that they ultimately need to restore Hyrule back to its former glory.\n  \n\n   Her favorite food is\n   Fruitcake\n   , as revealed by a recipe in a book in the Library in Hyrule Castle.\n  \n\n\n    Sequel to\n    \n     Breath of the Wild\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Princess Zelda\n   \n   appears in the\n   Sequel to\n   \n    Breath of the Wild\n   \n   . Picking up where the true ending left off, Zelda alongside Link traversed through a cave, only to find\n   \n    a mummified Gerudo corpse\n   \n   with an ethereal hand touching its chest, as well as it attracting Malice. She eventually ended up separated from Link, and witnessed the corpse revive itself via the malice.\n  \n\n\n    Other Appearances\n   \n\n\n   Princess is also featured in other media, including comics based on the games, animated shows, and the\n   \n    Super Smash Bros.\n   \n   series\n    . In some of her appearances, she is depicted as a brave, proud, and self-reliant fighter who is proficient in archery and horseback riding, such as in the\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   comics\n   by\n   Valiant Comics\n   and\n   \n\n     The Legend of Zelda\n    \n    TV series\n   \n   . As with the games, she is the protector of the Triforce of Wisdom.\n  \n\n\n    Alter Egos\n   \n\n\n\n    Sheik\n   \n\n\n   In\n   \n    Ocarina of Time\n   \n   , Link met up with a mysterious member of the\n   \n    Sheikah\n   \n   Tribe, fittingly called Sheik. This person taught\n   \n    Link\n   \n   a multitude of different songs and gave him tips on how to proceed in his quest. At the end of the game, Sheik revealed himself to be none other than Princess Zelda in a disguise.\n    During the seven years Link had been asleep while maturing to become ready to fight\n   \n    Ganondorf\n   \n   , Zelda had gone underground and taken the disguise as Sheik so that Ganondorf would not find her in his search for the two remaining pieces of the\n   \n    Triforce\n   \n   , one which was held by Princess Zelda herself.\n  \n\n   Sheik is also a playable character in\n   \n    Super Smash Bros. Melee\n   \n   and\n   \n    Super Smash Bros. Brawl\n   \n   : Zelda is able to transform into Sheik during a battle, allowing her to use a different set of moves.\n  \n\n\n    Tetra\n   \n\n\n   Born into a society of pirates on the Great Sea, Tetra, captain of a\n   \n    crew of pirates\n   \n   , was completely unaware that she was a member of the Royal Family of Hyrule's bloodline.\n    When this was revealed to her by\n   \n    Daphnes Nohansen Hyrule\n   \n   , she was just as surprised as Link to find out that she was indeed a descendant of Princess Zelda of Hyrule and also the one destined to be the keeper of the Triforce of Wisdom.\n  \n\n\n    Leader of the Sages\n   \n\n\n   In\n   \n\n     Ocarina of Time\n    \n\n   , Zelda is revealed to be the seventh\n   \n    Sage\n   \n   and the leader of them all.\n    Though no conclusive evidence has been sighted, Zelda is often seen as the proverbial\n   Sage of Time\n   , via several events that occur in\n   \n    Ocarina of Time\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Goddess Hylia\n   \n\n\n   Before the events of\n   \n\n     Skyward Sword\n    \n\n   , a goddess named Hylia defeated\n   \n    Demise\n   \n   . In order to protect the\n   \n    Triforce\n   \n   , in a two-part plan, Hylia renounced her divine body to reborn in an human being. This human was born eons after under the name of Zelda.\n  \n\n\n    Other Princesses of Hyrule\n   \n\n\n   Besides the Princess Zeldas that appear in the games, the back story to some of the games feature additional unnamed Princesses of Hyrule who have a similar appearance to Princess Zelda.\n  \n\n\n    Princess from the\n    \n     Minish Legend\n    \n\n\n\n   The back story of\n   \n\n     The Minish Cap\n    \n\n   tells of the\n   Minish Legend\n   . In the\n   \n    Minish Legend\n   \n   , a hero clad in green clothes, the\n   Hero of Men\n   arose to fight the demons attacking the world. This story of the\n   \n    Minish Legend\n   \n   is depicted in a series of stained glass windows beneath the\n   Elemental Sanctuary\n   . One of the stained glass windows depicts a Princess of Hyrule wielding the\n   \n    Light Force\n   \n   . Using the stained glass window,\n   \n    Vaati\n   \n   is able to deduce that the Light Force is currently held by the current Princess Zelda.\n  \n\n\n    Antediluvian Princess\n   \n\n\n   In\n   \n\n     The Wind Waker\n    \n\n   , when Link travels to\n   \n    Hyrule Castle\n   \n   beneath the\n   \n    Great Sea\n   \n   , there is a portrait of the Princess of Hyrule (around the age of\n   \n    Tetra\n   \n   ) from before the\n   \n    Great Flood\n   \n   hanging on the wall of the castle. In the portrait, the princess is surrounded by several characters, all of which have a counterpart to a member of\n   \n    Tetra's Pirate Crew\n   \n   . It is known that during the Great Flood, she took a piece of the\n   \n    Triforce of Wisdom\n   \n   which had been broken in two by her\n   \n    father\n   \n   and fled to the mountaintops with several of her servants.\n  \n\n\n    Ten Thousands Years prior to\n    \n\n      Breath of the Wild\n     \n\n\n\n\n   Learned by\n   \n    Impa\n   \n   and\n   Kass\n   , the Zelda that lived ten thousand years prior to the events of\n   \n    Breath of the Wild\n   \n   assisted Link and the four\n   \n    Champions\n   \n   in defending Hyrule from Calamity Ganon. Successfully defeating the Calamity, Zelda sealed Ganon away for ten thousand years, leading to his release one hundred years before the events of\n   \n    Breath of the Wild\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n    Zelda's Weapons\n   \n\n\n\n    Bow and Arrows of Light\n   \n\n\n   In several games, starting with\n   \n\n     Ocarina of Time\n    \n\n   , Zelda either wields the Light Arrows or bestows them on Link, allowing him to defeat Ganon. In some cases, she is also able to summon a magical bow made from pure light in order to fire the arrows.\n  \n\n   In\n   \n\n     Hyrule Warriors\n    \n\n   , the magical bow and light arrows can be summoned as part of Zelda's combos and special attacks while wielding her rapiers.\n  \n\n\n    Rapier\n   \n\n\n   In\n   \n\n     Twilight Princess\n    \n\n   , Zelda carries an ornate rapier, seemingly as a\n   \n    sword of state\n   \n   . When possessed by\n   \n    Ganondorf\n   \n   , she also uses it as a weapon against Link.\n  \n\n   In\n   \n\n     Hyrule Warriors\n    \n\n   , this rapier is named the \"Polished Rapier\", and is one of several rapiers the princess can use, alongside the more ornate Glittering Rapier, the extravagant Gleaming Rapier, which also bears the royal crest, and the humorous 8-Bit\n   White Sword\n   , a joke weapon.\n  \n\n\n    Baton\n   \n\n\n   While Zelda does not wield the\n   \n    Wind Waker\n   \n   in its titular introduction,\n   \n\n     The Wind Waker\n    \n\n   , it is claimed to be an instrument of the royal family used by the monarch in conducting the\n   \n    Sages\n   \n   .\n  \n\n   In\n   \n\n     Hyrule Warriors\n    \n\n   , Zelda is able to use the Wind Waker to conduct magical songs that summon wind and lightning. She can also use the Sacred Baton, which resembles a crystallized gust of wind, and the Glorious Baton, which resembles a\n   \n    Great Fairy\n   \n   's locks of hair.\n  \n\n\n    Trivia\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Link's Awakening\n     \n\n    and\n    \n\n      Tri Force Heroes\n     \n\n    are the only games where\n    \n     Princess Zelda\n    \n    's presence is completely absent. However, Link mentions her at the beginning of\n    \n     Link's Awakening\n    \n    .\n    \n     Princess Zelda\n    \n    's clothing, the\n    Legendary Dress\n    , also appears in\n    \n     Tri Force Heroes\n    \n    , which is based on its design from\n    \n\n      A Link Between Worlds\n     \n\n    .\n   \n\n\n     Breath of the Wild\n    \n    is the first main series game to supply\n    \n     Princess Zelda\n    \n    with English voice acting. In it, she speaks with an English accent. It is technically also the second main series game to supply full voice acting overall, with the\n    \n     Navi Trackers\n    \n    mode for the Japanese version of\n    \n\n      Four Swords Adventures\n     \n\n    being the first with Zelda's alter-ego\n    \n     Tetra\n    \n    .\n   \n\n    What Zelda says to Link regarding his memories and courage immediately prior to the final battle with Ganon in\n    \n     Breath of the Wild\n    \n    varied between languages. In the Japanese version, Zelda states that she believes in Link and his courage regardless of whether he regained his memories,\n     while in the English localization, she instead states that courage doesn't need to be remembered due to one never forgetting the concept in the first place.\n   \n\n    During the final battle with\n    \n     Ganon\n    \n    in\n    \n\n      Ocarina of Time\n     \n\n    and its remake\n    \n\n      Ocarina of Time 3D\n     \n\n    , whenever\n    \n     Link\n    \n    ends up hit by one of Ganon's attacks,\n    \n     Princess Zelda\n    \n    can be heard gasping in horror.\n   \n\n\n\n    Shigeru Miyamoto\n   \n   stated that the Princess Zelda's name originated from Zelda Fitzgerald, the wife of the acclaimed author, F. Scott Fitzgerald.\n    The name \"Zelda\" ultimately derives from \"Griselda,\" which may come from the Germanic elements\n   \n    gris\n   \n   (\"gray\") and\n   \n    hild\n   \n   (\"battle\"). Griselda itself means \"happy\", \"lucky\", or \"blessed\", while Grizelda means \"endless patience\".\n  \n\n\n\n\n      Names in Other Regions\n     \n\n\n\n      Language\n     \n\n      Name\n     \n\n      Meaning\n     \n\n\n\n      English\n     \n\n      Zelda\n     \n\n\n\n      Japanese\n     \n\n      ゼルダ (\n      \n       Zeruda\n      \n      )\n       ゼルダ姫 (\n      \n       Zeruda-hime\n      \n      )\n       ゼルダ姫 (\n      \n       Zeruda-hime\n      \n      )\n       ゼルダ姫 (\n      \n       Zeruda-hime\n      \n      )\n       ゼルダ姫 (\n      \n       Zeruda-hime\n      \n      )\n       ゼルダ姫 (\n      \n       Zeruda-hime\n      \n      )\n     \n\n      Zelda\n     \n\n\n\n      Chinese\n     \n\n      塞尔达 (\n      \n       Sàiěrdá\n      \n      )\n     \n\n\n\n      Chinese\n     \n\n      薩爾達 (\n      \n       Sàěrdá\n      \n      )\n     \n\n\n\n      Dutch\n     \n\n      Zelda\n     \n\n\n\n      French\n     \n\n      Zelda\n     \n\n\n\n      French\n     \n\n      Zelda\n       Princesse Zelda\n       Princesse Zelda\n       Princesse Zelda\n     \n\n      Princess Zelda\n       Princess Zelda\n     \n\n\n\n      German\n     \n\n      Prinzessin Zelda\n       Zelda\n       Zelda\n       Zelda\n       Zelda\n     \n\n      Princess Zelda\n     \n\n\n\n      Modern Hebrew\n     \n\n      הנסיכה זלדה (\n      \n       hnschh zldh\n      \n      )\n     \n\n\n\n      Italian\n     \n\n      Zelda\n       Principessa Zelda\n       Principessa Zelda\n     \n\n      Princess Zelda\n     \n\n\n\n      Korean\n     \n\n      젤다 (\n      \n       Jelda\n      \n      )\n       젤다 공주가 (\n      \n       Jelda Gongjuga\n      \n      )\n     \n\n\n\n      Russian\n     \n\n      Зельду (\n      \n       Zel'da\n      \n      )\n       Зельда (\n      \n       Zel'da\n      \n      )\n       Принцесса Зельда (\n      \n       Printsessa Zel'da\n      \n      )\n     \n\n\n\n      Spanish\n     \n\n      Zelda\n       Princesa Zelda\n     \n\n\n\n      Spanish\n     \n\n      Zelda\n     \n\n\n\n\n       This table was generated using\n        .\n        To request an addition, please\n        a\n       \n        staff member\n       \n       with a\n       \n        reference\n       \n       .\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n",

The Japanese version of the game on the Famicom is known as\n   \n\n     The Hyrule Fantasy: The Legend of Zelda\n    \n\n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Story\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Gameplay\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         2.1\n        \n\n\n          Dungeon\n         \n         Exploration\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         2.2\n        \n\n\n          Overworld\n         \n         Exploration\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         2.3\n        \n\n         Second Quest\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Game Information\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         Development\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Japanese Version\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.3\n        \n\n         Graphics and Audio\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.4\n        \n\n         Setting\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.5\n        \n\n         Timeline Placement\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.6\n        \n\n         Mistranslations\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.7\n        \n\n         Credits\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.8\n        \n\n         Completion Records\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Listings\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.1\n        \n\n         Characters\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.2\n        \n\n         Bosses\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.3\n        \n\n         Enemies\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.4\n        \n\n         Dungeons\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.5\n        \n\n         Items\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.6\n        \n\n         Translations\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.7\n        \n\n         Credits\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.8\n        \n\n         Glitches\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Reception\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.1\n        \n\n         Sales\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.2\n        \n\n         Reviews\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         5.3\n        \n\n         Fan Reception\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       6\n      \n\n       Ports and Remakes\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       7\n      \n\n       Legacy\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       8\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       9\n      \n\n       Nomenclature\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Story\n   \n\n\n\n    \"A long, long time ago the World was in an age of Chaos.\n   \n\n\n\n    \"In the midst of this chaos, in a little kingdom in the land of Hyrule, a legend was being handed down from generation to generation, the legend of the 'Triforce'; golden triangles possessing mystical powers. One day, an evil army attacked this peaceful little kingdom and stole the Triforce of Power. This army was led by Ganon, the powerful Prince of Darkness who sought to plunge the World into fear and darkness under his rule. Fearing his wicked rule, Zelda, the princess of this kingdom, split up the Triforce of Wisdom into eight fragments and hid them throughout the realm to save the last remaining Triforce from the clutches of the evil Ganon. At the same time, she commanded her most trustworthy nursemaid, Impa, to secretly escape into the land and go find a man with enough courage to destroy the evil Ganon. Upon hearing this, Ganon grew angry, imprisoned the princess, and sent out a party in search of Impa.\"\n   \n\n\n\n    \"Braving forests and mountains, Impa fled for her life from her pursuers. As she reached the very limit of her energy she found herself surrounded by Ganon's evil henchmen. Cornered! What could she do? ... But wait! All was not lost. A young lad appeared. He skillfully drove off Ganon's henchmen, and saved Impa from a fate worse than death.\"\n   \n\n\n\n    \"His name was Link. During his travels, he had come across Impa and Ganon's henchmen. Impa told Link the whole story of Princess Zelda and the evil Ganon. Burning with a sense of justice, Link resolved to save Zelda, but Ganon was a powerful opponent. He held the Triforce of Power. And so, in order to fight off Ganon, Link had to bring the scattered eight fragments of the Triforce of Wisdom together to rebuild the mystical triangle. If he couldn't do this, there would be no chance Link could fight his way into Death Mountain where Ganon lived.\"\n   \n\n\n\n    \"Can Link really destroy Ganon and save Princess Zelda?\n   \n\n\n\n    \"Only your skill can answer that question. Good luck. Use the Triforce wisely.\"\n   \n\n\n\n    Gameplay\n   \n\n\n   The game itself introduces a new level of gaming, one that includes roleplaying, action, adventure, and puzzle/logic.\n  \n\n\n\n     Dungeon\n    \n    Exploration\n   \n\n\n   Barring\n   Link\n   's progress are\n   Creatures\n   he must battle to locate the entrances to nine underground\n   Dungeons\n   . Each\n   \n    Dungeon\n   \n   is a unique, maze-like collection of rooms connected by doors and secret passages and guarded by monsters different from those found on the\n   Overworld\n   .\n   \n    Link\n   \n   must successfully navigate each\n   \n    Dungeon\n   \n   to obtain one of the eight pieces of the\n   Triforce of Wisdom\n   .\n   \n    Dungeons\n   \n   also conceal useful items, such as a\n   Boomerang\n   for retrieving items and stunning\n   \n    Enemies\n   \n   and a\n   Flute\n   with magical properties. The first six\n   \n    Dungeons\n   \n   have visible entrances, but the remaining three are hidden. Except for the final\n   \n    Dungeon\n   \n   , which can't be entered until the previous eight have been completed, the order of completing\n   \n    Dungeons\n   \n   is somewhat arbitrary, but many\n   \n    Dungeons\n   \n   can only be reached using items gained in the previous one.\n  \n\n\n\n     Overworld\n    \n    Exploration\n   \n\n\n   Non-linearity, the ability to take different paths to complete the game, separated\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   from its contemporaries.\n   \n    Link\n   \n   can freely wander the\n   \n    Overworld\n   \n   , finding and buying items at any point. This flexibility enables unusual ways of playing the game; for example, it's possible to reach the\n   final Boss\n   of\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   (but not defeat him) without taking a\n   Sword\n   . Nintendo of America's management initially feared that players might become frustrated with the new concept, left wondering what to do next. As a result, the American version of the game's manual contains many hints, tips, and suggestions for players.\n  \n\n\n    Second Quest\n   \n\n\n   After completing the game, the player has access to a more difficult quest, officially referred to as the\n   \n    Second Quest\n   \n   , where\n   \n    Dungeons\n   \n   and the placement of items are different, with\n   \n    Enemies\n   \n   stronger. Although a more difficult \"replay\" wasn't unique to\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   , few games offered a \"second quest\" with entirely different levels to complete. Entering \"ZELDA\" as the player's name starts the\n   \n    Second Quest\n   \n   immediately.\n   The\n   \n    Second Quest\n   \n   can be replayed each time it's completed.\n  \n\n\n    Game Information\n   \n\n\n\n    Development\n   \n\n\n   Shortly before starting development for\n   \n\n     Super Mario Bros.\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n    Shigeru Miyamoto\n   \n   began developing\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   as a launch title for the\n   Famicom\n   Disk System.\n   Miyamoto got inspiration from his own explorations to the countryside and hillsides around his home for an adventure game.\n   Seeking to create a fairytale setting, co-developer\n   \n    Takashi Tezuka\n   \n   drew inspiration from\n   \n    J. R. R. Tolkien's\n   \n\n\n     Lord of the Rings\n    \n\n   novels when writing the story.\n   With the\n   \n    medieval\n   \n   sword and sorcery theme set, Miyamoto wanted to have treasure hunting gameplay to also bring in the sense of adventure seen in movies such as\n   \n\n     Indiana Jones\n    \n\n   .\n   The game began as a two player dungeon creator, but later became a one-player game with underground dungeons that surrounded\n   \n    Death Mountain\n   \n   , with forests, lakes, and\n   \n    Hyrule Field\n   \n   added eventually as they wanted to explore aboveground too. Miyamoto wanted to call the game\n   \n    The Legend of\n   \n   something, so a PR planner suggested\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   , the name of\n   \n    F. Scott Fitzgerald\n   \n   's wife.\n  \n\n\n    Japanese Version\n   \n\n\n\n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   was originally released in 1986 as a flagship title for the\n   Famicom Disk System\n   in Japan. Apart from facilitating data saving, the disk drive also added an extra sound channel on top of the Famicom's original five. This has caused the original release to sport a quite different sound compared to the more widespread cartridge release. This difference is most notable during the title screen.\n  \n\n   The\n   Book of Magic\n   is known as the\n   \n    Bible\n   \n   in the Japanese version of the game. This was likely changed because it violated Nintendo of America's, at the time, very strict content guidelines which among others disapproved of any religious content or references inside games released for their systems. Interestingly enough, all depictions of the cross were kept intact.\n  \n\n   The Japanese Famicom Disk System version was included in a promotional package of Charumera-brand ramen, and was only given out as a prize for a contest. It is unknown what differences this version has compared to the original release, as the only available copies are incredibly expensive.\n  \n\n\n    Graphics and Audio\n   \n\n\n   Being a game designed for storage in a floppy disk, the game's graphics do not use too many elements; sprites are given different color palettes depending on their location in the overworld. For example, trees can be colored either green or orange; brick walls in dungeons are painted blue, green, yellow or white, and so on.\n  \n\n   The game features three background themes: the overworld tune, the standard dungeon tune and the final dungeon tune. The first theme has become the franchise's main theme, and it is often reused in other games in the franchise. The dungeon theme is used as the theme for the\n   Royal Crypt\n   in\n   \n\n     The Minish Cap\n    \n\n   and in the\n   \n    Color Dungeon\n   \n   in\n   \n\n     Link's Awakening DX\n    \n\n   . Sound samples such as the one when Link collects a new item and the one when a new path is open are also often reused in later\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   games.\n  \n\n   The Japanese Famicom Disk System version of the game utilizes the Disk System's additional frequency-modulation synthesis chip; the music sounds more lifelike as a result.\n  \n\n\n    Setting\n   \n\n\n   With this game being the first in the franchise, it is the first time\n   \n    Hyrule\n   \n   is portrayed, and it is divided into numerous parts and landscapes, such as the\n   \n    Lost Woods\n   \n   ,\n   \n    Death Mountain\n   \n   , a central lake, a\n   forest\n   , a\n   \n    graveyard\n   \n   , and a shore; as Link walks through them, he manages to find the hidden labyrinths where the fragments of the\n   \n    Triforce\n   \n   are kept. It's unknown whether or not the nameless regions reappeared in later games with official names.\n  \n\n   Unlike most overworlds in\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   series, this incarnation of Hyrule is entirely explorable from the beginning, meaning that Link can go to almost any corner and space of it, with a total absence of linearity. It should be noted that the overworld remains largely unchanged in the\n   \n    Second Quest\n   \n   , with the only changes being the locations of the labyrinths and of special prizes.\n  \n\n\n    Timeline Placement\n   \n\n\n   According to the\n   \n    timeline\n   \n   revealed in\n   \n\n     Hyrule Historia\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   takes place in the \"Downfall\" branch, which, in a whole, takes place after\n   \n\n     Ocarina of Time\n    \n\n   . After\n   \n    Ganon\n   \n   is defeated in\n   \n\n     A Link to the Past\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n\n     Oracle of Seasons\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Oracle of Ages\n    \n\n   and in\n   \n\n     A Link Between Worlds\n    \n\n   where Link and Zelda recovered the Triforce from Yuga-Ganon, Hyrule entered The Golden Era, in which the wise\n   \n    Hyrule monarchs\n   \n   used the Triforce to govern the land. After the\n   \n    king\n   \n   's death and the attempt of the\n   \n    Prince of Hyrule\n   \n   to assemble the complete Triforce, Hyrule was lead into the 'Era of Decline'. The Prince of Darkness, Ganon was revived, leading to the events of\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   . Six years later, the events of\n   \n    The Adventure of Link\n   \n   take place.\n  \n\n   Both this game and its sequel are linked in continuity, since the first game revolves around retrieving two of the major fragments of the Triforce, and Ganon is fought in order to rescue\n   \n    Princess Zelda\n   \n   ; the second game revolves around finding the third major fragment in order to revive an incarnation of Zelda that was comatose for a very long time, and to impede the revival of Ganon.\n  \n\n\n    Mistranslations\n   \n\n\n\n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   is littered with mistranslations, direct word-for-word translations, and odd quotes.\n  \n\n\n    The intro story is written poorly, such as stating the Triforce piece Ganon stole is the \"Triforce with power\", instead of\n    \n     Triforce of Power\n    \n    . For the GBA and Wii Virtual Console ports, the message was entirely rewritten.\n   \n\n    This is the first\n    \n     Zelda\n    \n    game in which Ganon is written as\n    \n     Gannon\n    \n    . This spelling was also used in the Famicom Disk System version of\n    \n     The Adventure of Link\n    \n    and in the Super Famicom release of\n    \n     A Link to the Past\n    \n    .\n   \n\n    The Old Man is well known for his vagueness in messages. One of his most famous quotations is \"DODONGO DISLIKES SMOKE\", indicating the\n    \n     Dodongo\n    \n    's weakness to\n    \n     bombs\n    \n    . Another odd quote is \"DIGDOGGER HATES CERTAIN KINDS OF SOUND\".\n   \n\n    The list of items is titled \"all of treasures\". The \"of\" was omitted in subsequent re-releases.\n   \n\n    When Link pays the\n    \n     Old Woman\n    \n    behind the waterfall, she will tell him to \"Go up, up, the mountaintop.\" This was corrected to saying, \"Go up, up, the mountain ahead\". This refers to the path to\n    Level 5\n    .\n   \n\n\n\n    Credits\n   \n\n\n   In the\n   credits\n   , all but the executive producer\n   \n    Hiroshi Yamauchi\n   \n   are listed under pseudonyms. Designer\n   \n    Takashi Tezuka\n   \n   is credited as \"Ten Ten,\" sound composer\n   \n    Koji Kondo\n   \n   as \"Konchan,\" programmer I. Marui as \"Marumaru.\" At the time, nicknames were commonly used among Japanese game developers as a company measure against employee poaching.\n  \n\n   Producer and director\n   \n    Shigeru Miyamoto\n   \n   is listed as \"S. Miyahon,\" a mistranscription of his name — 本 can be read as either \"moto\" or \"hon.\"\n   This is widely believed to be another error in translation. However, in a leaked prototype of the game, many of the staff — including Miyamoto — were credited under their real names.\n   The pseudonym \"Miyahon\" was thus chosen deliberately for the final release.\n  \n\n\n    Completion Records\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Time\n     \n\n      Performer\n     \n\n      Date\n     \n\n      Notes\n     \n\n\n\n      Any%\n     \n\n      Schicksal\n     \n\n      27m 21s\n     \n\n      July 25, 2021\n     \n\n\n\n      Any%\n      \n       (All Glitches Except Up + A)\n      \n\n\n      Schicksal\n     \n\n      27m 54s\n     \n\n      January 6, 2021\n     \n\n\n\n      100%\n     \n\n      Schicksal\n     \n\n      34m 2s\n     \n\n      April 27, 2021\n     \n\n\n\n      100%\n      \n       (All Glitches Except Up + A)\n      \n\n\n      Greenmario\n     \n\n      35m 18s\n     \n\n      April 29, 2021\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Low%\n      \n\n\n      lackattack\n     \n\n      31m 31s\n     \n\n      May 14, 2019\n     \n\n\n\n      Sword\n      -less\n     \n\n      lackattack\n     \n\n      32m 26s\n     \n\n      May 12, 2019\n     \n\n\n\n      Extreme Rules\n     \n\n      lackattack\n     \n\n      1h 25m 24s\n     \n\n      September 27, 2015\n     \n\n\n\n      Any%\n      \n       (\n       Second Quest\n       )\n      \n\n\n      Eunos\n     \n\n      2m 19s\n     \n\n      February 3, 2021\n     \n\n\n\n      Any%\n      \n       (\n       \n        Second Quest\n       \n       , No ACE)\n      \n\n\n      Schicksal\n     \n\n      30m 38s\n     \n\n      May 26, 2021\n     \n\n\n\n      Any%\n      \n       (\n       \n        Second Quest\n       \n       , No ACE or Up + A Glitch)\n      \n\n\n      Schicksal\n     \n\n      33m 50s\n     \n\n      February 19, 2020\n     \n\n\n\n      100%\n      \n       (\n       \n        Second Quest\n       \n       )\n      \n\n\n      Schicksal\n     \n\n      41m 38s\n     \n\n      March 14, 2020\n     \n\n\n\n      Low%\n      \n       (\n       \n        Second Quest\n       \n       )\n      \n\n\n      Antlerz\n     \n\n      42m 30s\n     \n\n      October 16, 2020\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Sword\n      \n      -less\n      \n       (\n       \n        Second Quest\n       \n       )\n      \n\n\n      Saver\n     \n\n      37m 19s\n     \n\n      June 9, 2019\n     \n\n\n\n      Extreme Rules\n      \n       (\n       \n        Second Quest\n       \n       )\n      \n\n\n      Eunos\n     \n\n      2h 2m 53s\n     \n\n      February 25, 2016\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n    Listings\n   \n\n\n\n    Characters\n   \n\n\n\n    Bosses\n   \n\n\n\n    Enemies\n   \n\n\n\n    Dungeons\n   \n\n\n\n    Items\n   \n\n\n\n    Credits\n   \n\n\n\n    Glitches\n   \n\n\n\n    Reception\n   \n\n\n\n    Sales\n   \n\n\n\n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   was commercially successful, selling a million copies nearly a year after its release,\n   and cumulating a total of 6.5 million copies worldwide, making it the fourth best-selling\n   Nintendo Entertainment System\n   game of all time.\n  \n\n\n    Reviews\n   \n\n\n   IGN journalist Craig Harris awarded the\n   Game Boy Advance\n   version of the game with an 8.0 out of 10, praising its faithful adaptation from the original version;\n   Damien McFerran from Nintendolife gave the Virtual Console version (Wii) the same score, praising the length and the complexity of the quest.\n   Nintendojo staff, when reviewing the GCN edition (\n   \n\n     Collector's Edition\n    \n\n   ) praised the game for its \"innovative and unique gameplay system, remarkably deep puzzle solving, and an epic score\".\n   Nintendo Power, in the December 2009 issue, placed the game\n   \n    third\n   \n   in the list of best\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   games, citing its influence on gaming industry and praising its gameplay.\n  \n\n\n    Fan Reception\n   \n\n\n   The game received support from the player community as well. It currently holds an average user score of 9.1 at GameSpot,\n   as well as a current average reader score of 9.1 at IGN.\n  \n\n\n    Ports and Remakes\n   \n\n\n   A remake of the original game,\n   \n\n     BS The Legend of Zelda\n    \n\n   , was broadcast via the\n   BS-X Broadcasting System\n   . The gameplay is similar to the original, but differs as the game's central heroes are the\n   mascot characters\n   of the BS-X Broadcasting System, who are otherwise supposed to be based on the player as the character's name and gender is associated with the broadcasting ID. Aside from the initial green tunic, the male character wears a backwards baseball cap, and the female character has long red hair.\n  \n\n   In 2003, Nintendo released a bundle for the\n   Nintendo GameCube\n   which included the\n   \n\n     Collector's Edition\n    \n\n   , in which\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   is playable. This version notably provided a different and more accurate translation of the game script, which was used in most subsequent ports of the game.\n   It also included a few other changes, such as reduced screen flashing.\n  \n\n\n\n     Animal Crossing\n    \n\n   , also released in 2003, includes a number of emulated NES games as furniture pieces, though some are inaccessible without a cheating device.\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   is one such unobtainable game.\n  \n\n\n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   saw a port on the\n   Game Boy Advance\n   as part of the \"Classic NES Series\" re-releases in 2004.\n  \n\n   Ports of\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   were released on the Virtual Console service for the\n   \n    Wii\n   \n   ,\n   Nintendo 3DS\n   , and the\n   \n    Wii U\n   \n   . The Wii Virtual Console port was released in 2006 in most regions, releasing alongside the launch of the service. The 3DS Virutual port was initially available on August 31, 2011, as one of the games eligible for free download as part of the Nintendo 3DS Ambassador Program, a service available to players who bought a 3DS before its price dropped on August 11, 2011.\n   It was later released to the public in 2012 in most regions. The Wii U Virtual Console port was released in 2013. Nearly all Virtual Console ports uses the updated changes from the 2003\n   \n    Collector's Edition\n   \n   version, with the exception of the 3DS Virtual Console port, which instead uses the original game's script.\n  \n\n\n\n     Super Smash Bros. Brawl\n    \n\n   features a number of timed, short demos of classic games, called \"Masterpieces\", in which players may only play up to a certain number of minutes depending on the game.\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   is offered as one of the Masterpieces, and is limited to two minutes of gameplay time. It returns as part of the Masterpieces library of\n   \n\n     Super Smash Bros. for Wii U\n    \n\n   ,  where the playtime for the demo has been doubled to four minutes.\n  \n\n   The\n   \n    NES Classic Edition\n   \n   includes\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   as one of the 30 games available.\n  \n\n\n    The Nintendo Entertainment System - Nintendo Switch Online\n   \n   software, available to Nintendo Switch Online Subscribers, included\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   as one of its 20 launch titles. Later on during the platform's life, a \"special save data\" for the game was introduced, titled \"The Legend of Zelda™ Living the life of luxury!\", that starts the game with more items and rupees in the players' possession.\n  \n\n\n    Legacy\n   \n\n\n\n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   is the first installment in the\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   franchise, and its success allowed the development of sequels. In one or another way, nearly every title in the series is influenced by this game in such ways as:\n  \n\n\n    The distinction between an overworld and a dungeon, as well as the need of traveling across the former to enter the latter, and to clear the latter to take a further step to the game's completion.\n   \n\n    The use of items to progress on the adventure, be it to beat enemies more easily or to open new ways and solve puzzles.\n   \n\n    The introduction of Link, Princess Zelda and Ganon.\n   \n\n    The introduction of the first two fragments of the\n    \n     Triforce\n    \n    .\n   \n\n    The introduction of a number of recurring locations (e.g.\n    \n     Lost Woods\n    \n    and\n    \n     Death Mountain\n    \n    ) and items.\n   \n\n    The presence of a\n    \n     Second Quest\n    \n    (although very few subsequent games reused this concept).\n   \n\n\n   The\n   \n    Moblin\n   \n   's quote\n   \"It's a secret to everybody\"\n   has become a popular\n   \n    meme\n   \n   among gamers over the years. It is first referenced in\n   \n\n     A Link to the Past\n    \n\n   when Link brings a chest to a man who stands next to a sign outside of the desert. He offers to open the chest under the condition that Link will \"keep it secret from everyone else\". It is also referenced in\n   \n\n     Ocarina of Time\n    \n\n   . If Link bribes the guard at the gate of Hyrule Castle, speaking after he opens the gate will result in him saying \"KEEP IT A SECRET TO EVERYBODY.\" And in\n   \n\n     Majora's Mask\n    \n\n   , after talking to Kafei in his home behind the\n   \n    Curiosity Shop\n   \n   , he says \"Keep what we just talked about a secret from everybody\". It is even referenced in\n   \n\n     Twilight Princess\n    \n\n   when in\n   \n    Center Castle Town\n   \n   , Link can enter a door and walk up to a balcony, where a\n   \n    Goron\n   \n   sees the golden force around\n   \n    Hyrule Castle\n   \n   . He admits that he has kept it \"a secret to everybody.\"\n  \n\n   The title theme for the game would later be used for the main theme of the game\n   \n\n     Hyrule Warriors\n    \n\n   , with bars from it also being used in the track \"Eclipse of the World\".\n  \n\n\n    Trivia\n   \n\n\n\n\n     The Hyrule Fantasy\n    \n    was used as a subtitle for the Japanese version of\n    \n     The Legend of Zelda\n    \n    ; however, this was dropped in subsequent games as adding a third subtitle (such as\n    \n     A Link to the Past\n    \n    ) would have made the title too long. This choice was also made to avoid comparisons with\n    \n\n      Final Fantasy\n     \n\n    .\n   \n\n    During development of the game, a rearrangement of\n    \n     Maurice Ravel\n    \n    's\n    \n     Boléro\n    \n    by\n    \n     Koji Kondo\n    \n    was used as the title theme. However, shortly before finishing the game, the developers learned that the song was still under copyright. Since they could not delay the release of the Disk System and the game itself, Kondo wrote the actual title theme in a single night.\n   \n\n    Most\n    \n     The Legend of Zelda\n    \n    cartridges are gold, but the Classic Series version of the game came in standard grey cartridges.\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Names in Other Regions\n     \n\n\n\n      Language\n     \n\n      Name\n     \n\n      Meaning\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Japanese\n      \n\n\n\n       THE HYRULE FANTASY ゼルダの伝説\n      \n\n       ゼルダの伝説\n      \n\n\n      The Hyrule Fantasy: The Legend of Zelda\n      The Legend of Zelda\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Chinese\n      \n\n\n\n       塞尔达传说\n      \n\n\n      Zelda Legend\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Chinese\n      \n\n\n\n       薩爾達傳說\n      \n\n\n      Zelda Legend\n     \n\n\n\n\n       German\n      \n\n\n      The Legend of Zelda\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Korean\n      \n\n\n\n       젤다의 전설\n      \n\n\n      The Legend of Zelda\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n   February 21, 2011 marked the\n   \n    25th anniversary of the\n    \n\n      The Legend of Zelda\n     \n     series\n    \n\n   , commemorating the Japanese release of the original\n   \n\n     The Legend of Zelda\n    \n\n   .

Though relatively simple by today's standards, it was quite advanced for its time. Innovations include the ability to use dozens of different items, a vast world full of secrets to explore, and the cartridge's ability to save progress via battery-backed memory. The game also features a \"Second Quest\", accessible upon completing the game, where dungeons and the placement of items are different and enemies stronger. Besides the game's technical innovations, the gameplay (finding items and using them to solve puzzles, battling monsters in real-time, and exploring a vast environment) was a successful formula and became widely copied. The game was wildly popular in Japan and North America, and many consider it one of the most important video games ever made. During the last years of the\n   Famicom\n   the game was re-released in cartridge format. A modified version known as\n   \n\n     BS The Legend of Zelda\n    \n\n   was released for the\n   \n    Super Famicom\n   \n   's satellite-based expansion,\n   Satellaview\n   , in the mid-1990s in Japan.\n   \n    BS Zelda\n   \n   was re-released for the Satellaview a year later with re-arranged dungeons and a re-arranged overworld (more or less a \"Second Quest\"). This re-release was dubbed\n   \n    BS Zelda ~MAP 2~\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     The Adventure of Link\n    \n\n\n\n   The second game, known as\n   \n\n     Zelda II: The Adventure of Link\n    \n\n   was released in July 1988, and was a departure from the concept of the first game. It exchanged the top-down perspective for side-scrolling and introduced RPG elements (e.g., experience points) not found in other\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   installments. It is also the only\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   title until\n   \n    Four Swords Adventures\n   \n   in which Link does not collect Rupees. Because of these fundamental changes, many consider it the \"black sheep\" of the series. Both this and its predecessor were notable for their gold-colored game cartridges, which stood out amongst the system's usual gray cartridges. This is an irony as both games were later re-released in the final years of the\n   Nintendo Entertainment System\n   with gray cartridges that happen to be harder to find than their gold-colored counterparts.\n  \n\n\n\n     A Link to the Past\n    \n\n\n\n   Four years later,\n   \n\n     A Link to the Past\n    \n\n   , returned to the top-down view (under a 3/4 perspective) and added the concept of an alternate dimension to explore, a land known as the Dark World. The game was released for the\n   \n    Super NES\n   \n   in 1991. It was later re-released for the\n   Game Boy Advance\n   on December 9, 2002 in North America, on a cartridge with\n   \n\n     Four Swords\n    \n\n   , the first multiplayer\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   , and then on the\n   \n    Wii's\n   \n   Virtual Console on January 22, 2007. In addition, both this game (unchanged except for being converted into a downloadable format) and an exclusive \"loosely based\" sequel (which used the same game engine) called\n   \n\n     BS The Legend of Zelda: Ancient Stone Tablets\n    \n\n   were released on the\n   \n    Satellaview\n   \n   in Japan. On April 17, 2013, a sequel to A Link To The Past was announced for the Nintendo 3DS. It featured the same Hyrule layout as A Link to the Past with new dungeons as well as a new ability for Link to be turned into a wall drawing, which can be used to go through walls and access different areas.\n  \n\n\n\n     Link's Awakening\n    \n\n\n\n   The next game,\n   \n\n     Link's Awakening\n    \n\n   , was the first\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   for\n   Nintendo\n   's\n   Game Boy\n   handheld on June 6, 1993 and is the first to take place outside of Hyrule. It was re-released for the\n   Game Boy Color\n   in 1998 as\n   \n\n     Link's Awakening DX\n    \n\n   with some additional features, including an extra color-based dungeon and a photo shop that allowed interaction with the\n   Game Boy Printer\n   .\n  \n\n\n    (1998-2002)\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Ocarina of Time\n    \n\n\n\n   After another hiatus, the series made the transition to 3D with the installment\n   \n\n     Ocarina of Time\n    \n\n   which was released in November 1998 in Japan and the US and December 1998 in Europe. This game, initially known as\n   \n    Zelda 64\n   \n   , retained the core gameplay of the previous 2D games and became one of the most successful games of all time in both commercial and critical terms. It is considered by some to be one of the best video games ever made, and scored perfect scores in several video game publications, including the first 40/40 score in Famitsu (a prestigious Japanese gaming magazine). In 2006 it was ranked by\n   Nintendo Power\n   as the best game to ever appear on a Nintendo console. The title was originally slated for the ill-fated, Japanese-only\n   Nintendo 64DD\n   , but was ported to a cartridge when the hardware was delayed. Innovations include the use of lock-on targeting, a new gameplay mechanic that focuses the camera on a nearby target and alters the player's actions to be relative to that target. Such mechanics allow precision-based swordfighting in a 3D space and were a revolutionary development for the time. Like its Nintendo Entertainment System predecessors,\n   \n    Ocarina of Time\n   \n   was notable for being released on a limited Collector's Edition gold cartridge (available mainly to those who pre-ordered the game) as well as a more traditional gray cartridge.\n  \n\n\n    Ocarina of Time\n   \n   was re-released on the\n   GameCube\n   in 2002 when it was offered as a pre-order incentive for\n   \n    The Wind Waker\n   \n   in the US and Japan. Europe continues to receive it free in every copy of\n   \n    The Wind Waker\n   \n   , except for the discounted\n   Player's Choice\n   version. It included a previously unreleased 64DD expansion known as\n   \n    Ura Zelda\n   \n   in Japan and\n   \n\n     Master Quest\n    \n\n   in North America, however the original\n   \n    Ura Zelda\n   \n   planned for the 64DD at the time was to enhance\n   \n    Ocarina of Time\n   \n   in most aspects, instead of being a dungeon remix, which\n   \n    Master Quest\n   \n   is.\n   \n    Ocarina of Time\n   \n   was included as part of\n   \n\n     Collector's Edition\n    \n\n   for the GameCube in 2003.\n  \n\n   The game was remade in 2011 as\n   \n\n     Ocarina of Time 3D\n    \n\n   on the Nintendo\n   3DS\n   , which added improved graphics, 3D effects,\n   \n    Boss Challenge\n   \n   mode and included the Master Quest.\n  \n\n\n\n     Majora's Mask\n    \n\n\n\n   The follow-up title,\n   \n\n     Majora's Mask\n    \n\n   which was released in November 2000, used the same 3D game engine as the previous\n   Nintendo 64\n   game (dropping the Fixed 3D elements), but added a novel time-based concept, leading to somewhat mixed reactions from series fans. It was originally called\n   \n    Zelda Gaiden\n   \n   , a Japanese title loosely translating to\n   \n    Zelda, Another Story\n   \n   . Gameplay changed significantly; in addition to a form of time limit, Link could use masks to transform into different creatures with unique skills. While\n   \n    Majora's Mask\n   \n   retained the graphical style of the landmark\n   \n    Ocarina of Time\n   \n   , it was also a departure, particularly in atmosphere. The game is much darker, dealing with death and tragedy in a manner not previously seen in the series, and has a sense of impending doom as a large moon slowly descends upon the land of Termina. All copies of\n   \n    Majora's Mask\n   \n   are gold cartridges. Instead a limited Collector's Edition lenticular cartridge label was offered as the pre-order incentive. Copies of the game that weren't Collector's Editions featured a more traditional sticker cartridge label.\n  \n\n   A remake of the game was released in 2015 as\n   \n\n     Majora's Mask 3D\n    \n\n   on the Nintendo\n   3DS\n   , which added, among many other changes, improved graphics and controls, 3D effects, and a\n   \n    fishing minigame\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Oracle of Ages\n    \n    &\n    \n     Oracle of Seasons\n    \n\n\n\n   The next two games,\n   \n\n     Oracle of Ages\n    \n\n   and\n   \n\n     Oracle of Seasons\n    \n\n   , were released simultaneously for the\n   Game Boy Color\n   , and interact using passwords or a Game Link Cable. After one game has been completed, the player is given a password that allows the other game to be played as a sequel. They were developed by\n   \n    Capcom\n   \n   in conjunction with Nintendo, with supervision from Miyamoto. After the team experimented with porting the original\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   to the Game Boy Color, they decided to make an original trilogy to be called the \"Triforce Series\". When the password system linking the three games proved too troublesome, the concept was reduced to two titles at Miyamoto's suggestion. These two titles became\n   \n    Oracle of Ages\n   \n   , which is more puzzle-based, and\n   \n    Oracle of Seasons\n   \n   , which is more action-oriented. The canceled third game was to be called\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda: Mystical Seed of Courage\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Four Swords\n    \n    sub-series (2002-2005)\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Four Swords\n    \n\n\n\n   In December 2002,\n   \n\n     A Link to the Past & Four Swords\n    \n\n   was released for the\n   Game Boy Advance\n   , comprising a modified port of\n   \n    A Link to the Past\n   \n   for the\n   \n    Super Nintendo Entertainment System\n   \n   , and an original multiplayer-only game titled\n   \n\n     Four Swords\n    \n\n   —the first multiplayer\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   game.\n  \n\n   The Link and Princess Zelda featured in this game are childhood friends. This is also the first game in which\n   \n    Vaati\n   \n   and the\n   \n    Four Sword\n   \n   appear. As part of the\n   \n    25th Anniversary of\n    \n     The Legend of Zelda\n    \n    series\n   \n   ,\n   \n\n     Four Swords Anniversary Edition\n    \n\n   was briefly made available as a free download for both the\n   Nintendo DSi\n   and\n   Nintendo 3DS\n   . The game was a special edition of\n   \n    Four Swords\n   \n   now featuring a single player mode.\n  \n\n\n\n     The Wind Waker\n    \n\n\n\n   When Nintendo revealed the\n   Nintendo GameCube\n   on August 24, 2000, the day before Nintendo's SpaceWorld 2000 exposition,\n   \n    one software demonstration\n   \n   showed a realistically-styled real-time duel between Ganon and Link. Fans and the media speculated that the battle might be from a\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   game under development. At Spaceworld 2001 Nintendo showed a cel-shaded\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   title, later released in December 2002 as\n   \n\n     The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker\n    \n\n   , which Miyamoto felt would \"extend Zelda's reach to all ages\". The media reported that\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   was shifting to a younger audience, to Miyamoto's surprise. Nothing further was shown until a playable demonstration was ready, which was well-received. The gameplay focused controlling wind with a magical baton called the \"Wind Waker\" and sailing a small boat around a massive, island-filled ocean.\n  \n\n   The game was re-released for\n   \n    Wii U\n   \n   in 2013 as\n   \n\n     The Wind Waker HD\n    \n\n   , which added improved graphics, faster sailing,\n   \n    Hero Mode\n   \n   , and online integration with Miiverse.\n  \n\n\n\n     Four Swords Adventures\n    \n\n\n\n   Next in the series came\n   \n\n     Four Swords Adventures\n    \n\n   for the\n   GameCube\n   , which was released in the first half of 2004 in Japan and America, and in January 2005 in Europe. Based on the handheld\n   \n\n     Four Swords\n    \n\n   ,\n   \n    Four Swords Adventures\n   \n   was another deviation from previous\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   gameplay, focusing on multiplayer gameplay and \"level-based\" action (like many\n   \n    Super Mario Bros.\n   \n   titles). The game contains 24 individual stages and a map screen; there is no connecting overworld. For the multiplayer features of the game, each player is required to use a\n   Game Boy Advance\n   system linked to the Nintendo GameCube via a GBA-GCN cable. Although it focuses on multiplayer, the game also features a single player campaign in which using a Game Boy Advance is optional.\n  \n\n\n    Four Swords Adventures\n   \n   is really two games in one: Hyrulean Adventure (with a storyline and action somewhat similar to a traditional\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   adventure) and Shadow Battle (a free-for-all melee \"battle mode\" which pits Links against each other as the players struggle for dominance in Hyrulean arenas). The Japanese and Korean versions include a third segment, known as\n   Navi Trackers\n   (originally designed as the stand-alone game Tetra's Trackers), which is not included in any other incarnation of the title. Navi Trackers contains an important first for\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   , as the game has spoken dialogue for most of the characters.\n  \n\n\n\n     The Minish Cap\n    \n\n\n\n   In November 2004 in Japan and Europe, and in January 2005 in America, Nintendo released a new game for the\n   Game Boy Advance\n   ,\n   \n\n     The Minish Cap\n    \n\n   . The central concept of\n   \n    The Minish Cap\n   \n   is Link's ability to shrink in size with the aid of a mystical sentient hat named\n   \n    Ezlo\n   \n   . While tiny, Link can see previously-explored parts of a dungeon from a new perspective, and enter new areas through otherwise impassable openings. Link is able to switch from big to small at special portals throughout the land, once again giving Link two \"worlds\" to play in. This game was also developed by Capcom under Nintendo's supervision.\n  \n\n\n    The Next Generation (2006-2011)\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Twilight Princess\n    \n\n\n\n   In November 2006,\n   \n\n     Twilight Princess\n    \n\n   arrived as the first\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   game on the\n   \n    Wii\n   \n   , although it was originally going to be a GameCube-only title. During the following month, December 2006, it was released on the Nintendo GameCube as well. The new game once again strives for a realistic look, improved even beyond the aforementioned SpaceWorld demo.\n   \n    Twilight Princess\n   \n   is set hundreds of years after the events of\n   \n    Majora's Mask\n   \n   . This game chronicles the struggle of a more mature Link, the descendant of the Hero of Time, to rid Hyrule of the \"\n   \n    Twilight Realm\n   \n   \", a mysterious force plaguing the land. When Link enters this realm, he transforms into a\n   \n    wolf\n   \n   and the gameplay shifts radically.\n   \n    Twilight Princess\n   \n   also focuses more heavily on\n   \n    horseback transportation\n   \n   and mounted battle scenarios (including boss battles) than previous installments.\n  \n\n\n\n     Phantom Hourglass\n    \n\n\n\n   Zelda DS was once rumored to be a new\n   \n    Four Swords\n   \n   game, but Nintendo later retracted those statements. Instead, at the 2006 Game Developers Conference a trailer for\n   \n\n     Phantom Hourglass\n    \n\n   for the Nintendo DS was shown. The trailer revealed traditional top-down Zelda gameplay optimized for the DS’s features, a cel-shaded graphical style directly recalling\n   \n    The Wind Waker\n   \n   . At E³ 2006, Nintendo confirmed its status as a direct sequel to\n   \n    The Wind Waker\n   \n   . Released on June 23, 2007,\n   \n    Phantom Hourglass\n   \n   features unique new controls making use of the\n   Nintendo DS\n   hardware capabilities, and incorporates a 1-on-1 multiplayer\n   battle mode\n   , supporting play both locally and online through the\n   Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection\n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Spirit Tracks\n    \n\n\n\n   On March 25, 2009, a trailer for the next\n   Nintendo DS\n   Zelda title:\n   \n\n     Spirit Tracks\n    \n\n   , was revealed at GDC 2009. It is set in the new-found Hyrule, 100 years after the events of\n   \n    Phantom Hourglass\n   \n   . A new Link appears wearing a conductor's outfit and hat. Early on in the game, Link obtains the\n   \n    Hero's Clothes\n   \n   .\n   \n    Spirit Tracks\n   \n   features the same cel-shaded graphics style that was seen in\n   \n    Phantom Hourglass\n   \n   and\n   \n    The Wind Waker\n   \n   . Also, the game features many new songs, with a few select melodies returning from\n   \n    Phantom Hourglass\n   \n   . The game was released towards the end of December around the world, and features the train mechanic, which replaces the steamboat from\n   \n    Phantom Hourglass'.\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Skyward Sword\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n     Skyward Sword\n    \n\n   is the 16th installment in\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   series. On June 2, 2009, IGN talked to Shigeru Miyamoto about the upcoming Zelda game for Wii. He made comments about the changes that the new motion plus would bring to the game, and said \"Think of Zelda while you're trying some of the archery and sword play in\n   \n\n     Wii Sports Resort\n    \n\n   .\" At E3 2010, the game was finally unveiled. According to the details given, Link lives in a land known as Skyloft which floats high above Hyrule. He learns that Hyrule is in danger and travels to the ground to save the kingdom. Much of the gameplay focuses heavily on the use of the Wii Motion Plus, allowing the players to have a much greater level of control over Link. At E3 2011, much of the game was unraveled by Miyamoto and Aonuma, including a new flying mechanism in the game. As for characters, a villain under the name\n   \n    Ghirahim\n   \n   causes some controversy in\n   \n    Skyloft\n   \n   , which leads to the kidnapping of Link's friend,\n   Zelda\n   . The game was released on November 18, 2011 in Europe and November 20, 2011 in North America.\n  \n\n\n    Rethinking the Conventions of Zelda (2013-present)\n   \n\n\n\n\n     A Link Between Worlds\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n     A Link Between Worlds\n    \n\n   for the 3DS is the 17th game in the series. It takes place in the same world as\n   \n    A Link to the Past\n   \n   and is a sequel to the SNES game. It takes place hundreds of years later, when forces from the parallel universe of\n   \n    Lorule\n   \n   invade Hyrule and turn its sages into paintings. The game is remarkable for its open-ended nature. Link can rent or buy key items from\n   \n    Ravio\n   \n   instead of finding them in dungeons, allowing him to complete dungeons in almost any order. Link can also turn into a painting to slip by obstacles or cross wide chasms. It features StreetPass support, allowing other players to enter the game as\n   \n    Shadow Links\n   \n   that Link can defeat for a large prize. The game was released on November 22, 2013 in North America and December 26 in Japan.\n  \n\n\n\n     Tri Force Heroes\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n     Tri Force Heroes\n    \n\n   for the 3DS is the 18th game in the series. It stars the same Link as its predecessor,\n   \n    A Link Between Worlds\n   \n   , who has fled Hyrule and disguised himself in order to avoid recognition. He stumbles across the land of\n   \n    Hytopia\n   \n   , whose\n   \n    princess\n   \n   was cursed to wear ugly clothing by\n   \n    a villainous witch\n   \n   . Link teams up with\n   \n    two similar heroes\n   \n   to journey through the\n   \n    Drablands\n   \n   and stop Lady Maud to free Princess Styla. The game uses an internet connection to allow three players to each control a Link, working together and communicating with icons. They can also\n   \n    stack\n   \n   on top of each other, an ability used throughout the game. The game is also fashion-based, with players being able to craft outfits with\n   \n    Madame Couture\n   \n   to gain special abilities.\n  \n\n\n\n     Breath of the Wild\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n     Breath of the Wild\n    \n\n   is the 19th game in the series. Link awakens from a 100 year sleep and is tasked with destroying\n   \n    Calamity Ganon\n   \n   before the world is destroyed. The game returns to the original\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   concept of a more open-world adventure, where Link is free to explore the world in any direction at any given moment. Major dungeons found in previous games have been replaced with four smaller\n   \n    Divine Beasts\n   \n   and numerous small\n   \n    Ancient Shrine\n   \n   scattered throughout the land. Several new elements were introduced as well, such as weapon durability, taming and registering wild horses, and abilities like\n   Shield  Surfing\n   and\n   Perfect Dodge\n   and\n   Guard\n   . The game was released simultaneously for the Wii U and\n   Nintendo Switch\n   on March 3, 2017.\n  \n\n\n    Remakes and Remasters\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Link's Awakening DX\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n     A Link to the Past & Four Swords\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n     Ocarina of Time 3D\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n     Four Swords Anniversary Edition\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n     The Wind Waker HD\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n     Majora's Mask 3D\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n     Twilight Princess HD\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n     Link's Awakening\n    \n    for Nintendo Switch\n   \n\n\n\n\n     Skyward Sword HD\n    \n\n\n\n\n    Skyward Sword HD\n   \n   is the switch release of\n   \n\n     Skyward Sword\n    \n\n   .

This game was bundled with the\n   Wii Zapper\n   instead of being sold as a typical release. The game reuses locales, enemies, and Link himself from\n   \n    Twilight Princess\n   \n   . This title has no overall plot, but includes two bosses near the end stages,\n   \n    Darknut\n   \n   and\n   Stallord\n   . Also unique to this title is the first-person shooter aspect; in place of the typical adventuring game play of the series. A multiplayer mode is offered, but even so, the gameplay remains played in single player phases. While using multiplayer, the Wii Zapper is passed from one player to the next in turns.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Non-Canon Information\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Hyrule Warriors\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n     Hyrule Warriors\n    \n\n   is a 2014\n   \n    Wii U\n   \n   game combining the action of the\n   \n\n     Dynasty Warriors\n    \n\n   series with elements of\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   . It was ported to the Nintendo 3DS in 2016 as\n   \n\n     Hyrule Warriors Legends\n    \n\n   , now including\n   \n    Tetra\n   \n   and the\n   \n    King of Hyrule\n   \n   as playable characters and new stages from\n   \n    The Wind Waker\n   \n   . Another port of the game was released for the Nintendo Switch on May 18, 2018 as\n   \n\n     Hyrule Warriors: Definitive Edition\n    \n\n   , which combines content from both the original\n   \n    Hyrule Warriors\n   \n   and\n   \n    Hyrule Warriors Legends\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ambiguously Canon Content\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Cadence of Hyrule\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n     Cadence of Hyrule\n    \n\n   is a 2019\n   Nintendo Switch\n   game that combines the rhythm-based gameplay of\n   \n    Crypt of the NecroDancer\n   \n   with the world and characters of\n   \n    The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   . It features the character\n   \n    Cadence\n   \n   from\n   \n    Crypt of the Necrodancer\n   \n   , who is mysteriously thrust into the land of\n   \n    Hyrule\n   \n   . With the aid of Link and\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   , Cadence attempts to stop\n   Octavo's\n   quest to take over Hyrule. Towards the end of the game, it is revealed that the true antagonist is\n   \n    Ganon\n   \n   , and Octavo was trying to stop him the whole time. On December 18, 2019, a free update was released for the game, called\n   \n    Octavo's Ode\n   \n   , which featured a new story mode revolving around Octavo and his quest. A\n   Season Pass\n   containing another three DLC packs and extra costumes for Link and Zelda was made available for purchase on July 20, 2020.\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Non-Canon Information\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n     Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity\n    \n\n   is a 2020\n   Nintendo Switch\n   game with the\n   \n\n     Dynasty Warriors\n    \n\n   gameplay of its predecessor set as an indirect prequel to\n   \n\n     Breath of the Wild\n    \n\n   . The story revolves around an alternate war set in motion when\n   Terrako\n   , a small\n   Guardian\n   , travels back in time seeking to change the cataclysmic outcome of the\n   \n    Great Calamity\n   \n   . Conversely,\n   Astor\n   , the Prophet of Doom, tries to stabilize events to ensure the return of\n   \n    Calamity Ganon\n   \n   . The game features local co-op multiplayer.\n  \n\n\n    Tingle Series\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Ambiguously Canon Content\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    The Tingle series of video games is a spin-off of The Legend of Zelda series, centered on\n    \n     Tingle\n    \n    , who originally appeared as a supporting character in\n    \n\n      Majora's Mask\n     \n\n    .\n   \n\n\n\n      Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland\n     \n\n\n   In November 2006,\n   \n\n     Freshly-Picked Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland\n    \n\n   was released in Japan. One year later, it was released in an English European version. The story begins when Tingle, a middle-aged man, is offered a life in\n   \n    Rupeeland\n   \n   , a\n   \n    Rupee\n   \n   paradise, by a mysterious character known as\n   Uncle Rupee\n   . Uncle Rupee guides Tingle, who goes on many quests and ventures into several\n   \n    Dungeons\n   \n   to gather Rupees. Tingle is told that when he gathers enough rupees and throws them into a magic spring, a tower will shoot fourth and take him to Rupeeland. This game was developed by\n   Vanpool\n   using Nintendo's permission.\n   \n\n\n      Tingle's Balloon Fight DS\n     \n\n\n\n\n     Tingle's Balloon Fight DS\n    \n\n   is a game that was only made available to Club Nintendo members in Japan. It was released in 2007, supposedly as a sequel to\n   \n    Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland\n   \n   . It's very similar to the original Balloon Fight game for the NES, but it has several differences as well. It stars Tingle as the main character, and adds music from\n   \n    Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland\n   \n   . It also has 20 pieces of artwork which can be \"unlocked\" by completing various tasks. The game has three different modes of play. The first is similar to the original\n   \n    Balloon Fight\n   \n   , in which the player must advance through all 99 levels. The second is a\n   \n    multiplayer\n   \n   version of the first game type. The third mode is Balloon Trip, in which Tingle must advance from level to level while crossing to sea. He must dodge lightning bolts while collecting \"gifts\".\n   \n\n\n      Ripened Tingle's Balloon Trip of Love\n     \n\n\n\n\n     Ripened Tingle's Balloon Trip of Love\n    \n\n   was released in Japan in August 2009, and was not released overseas. Similar to\n   \n    Tingle's Rosy Rupeeland\n   \n   , the game starts with an ordinary, 35-year-old man. While he watches a sales program on television, the man learns of a book that is deemed to make its readers popular amongst the ladies. He orders the book, but he gets sucked into the world of a picture book when he opens it and transforms into Tingle. He learns that the only way to get out of the book is to dance with the princess of this world, which is the main goal of the game. The game is a parody of the\n   \n    The Wizard of Oz\n   \n   , where Tingle meets three friends,\n   \n    Kakashi\n   \n   , the scarecrow,\n   Buriki\n   , the tin-woman, and\n   \n    Lion\n   \n   , the lion. Together, they follow the yellow-brick road, and advance from page to page. Unlike the previous installation of this series, this is a point-and-click game. This game was also developed by Vanpool using Nintendo's permission.\n  \n\n\n    CD-i Games\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Non-Canon Information\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    After aborting a partnership with Sony to make a CD add-on for the\n    \n     Super Nintendo\n    \n    , Nintendo signed a deal with Sony's rival Philips. After this deal also fell through, part of the compromise between Nintendo and Philips was allowing Philips to produce Zelda games for their\n    \n     CD-i console\n    \n    .\n   \n\n\n\n      The Faces of Evil\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      The Wand of Gamelon\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n      Zelda's Adventure\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n    Cancelled Games\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Names in Other Regions\n     \n\n\n\n      Language\n     \n\n      Name\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Japanese\n      \n\n\n      ゼルダの伝説 (\n      \n       Zeruda no Densetsu\n      \n      )\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        Non-Canon Information\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       BS The Legend of Zelda\n      \n\n\n\n\n      BS The Legend of Zelda loading screen\n     \n\n\n\n      Developer(s)\n     \n\n\n       Nintendo\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Publisher(s)\n     \n\n\n\n        St. GIGA\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n      Designer(s)\n     \n\n\n\n        Koji Kondo\n       \n       (original sound composer)\n       Akito Nakatsuka (sound composer)\n       Yuichi Ozaki (sound arrangement)\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Release date(s)\n     \n\n\n\n        Map 1\n       \n\n        Week 1\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n      Genre(s)\n     \n\n\n       Adventure RPG\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Game mode(s)\n     \n\n\n       Single Player\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Canonicity\n     \n\n\n       Non-Canon\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Successor\n     \n\n\n\n\n         Ancient Stone Tablets\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       BS The Legend of Zelda guide\n       at\n       \n        StrategyWiki\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n     BS The Legend of Zelda\n    \n\n   is a remake of the original\n   \n\n     The Legend of Zelda\n    \n\n   , which was released on the\n   Nintendo Entertainment System\n   , available only via the\n   \n    Satellaview\n   \n   add-on for the\n   \n    Super Nintendo Entertainment System\n   \n   . The gameplay is similar to the original, but there are several key differences.\n  \n\n\n    BS The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   is different from most other\n   \n\n     The Legend of Zelda\n    \n\n   games. The game's central heroes are the\n   avatar characters\n   of the BS-X, which are based on the info given during account creation, which is also true for the\n   \n\n     Ancient Stone Tablets\n    \n\n   . Both the male and female characters wear a\n   green tunic\n   , though others are later available. The male character wears a backwards baseball cap whereas the female character has long red hair, but is otherwise exactly the same as the male character.\n  \n\n\n    BS The Legend of Zelda\n   \n   was also the first Satellaview game to use the SoundLink system, where data was streamed simultaneously during broadcast including an orchestrated soundtrack and a voiceover track.\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Major Differences\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n       Gameplay\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Dungeons\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.1\n        \n\n         Map 1\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         3.2\n        \n\n         Map 2\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       4\n      \n\n       Listings\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.1\n        \n\n         Bosses\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.2\n        \n\n         Enemies\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n         4.3\n        \n\n         Glitches\n        \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n       5\n      \n\n       Nomenclature\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Major Differences\n   \n\n\n   The\n   \n    Overworld\n   \n   's size, for convenience due to the time system, has been cut in half vertically from an 8 × 16 grid to an 8 × 8 grid, making it square. The\n   \n    Dungeons\n   \n   and Overworld all look different, but the general landmarks remain the same. The game also included much higher quality graphics.\n  \n\n   The biggest difference, however, is the time system. During certain hours, different events happen, such as the characters receiving different power-ups or enemies becoming stronger. Due to the broadcasting nature of the game, it also had to be played in one sitting, and was only available for one hour every week.\n  \n\n\n    Gameplay\n   \n\n\n   At the beginning of the game, the character automatically walks into a cave, where the\n   \n    Old Man\n   \n   gives him or her the\n   Wooden Sword\n   . The dungeons are all in the same place in both Map 1 and 2, but the Overworld and dungeon interiors are completely redone between versions. The dungeons also spell out different phrases. The character must complete all eight dungeons and obtain the eight pieces of the\n   \n    Triforce\n   \n   . Two of the pieces are available in each week.\n  \n\n   During gameplay, the old man would continue to communicate with the player about new events, sometimes pausing gameplay during dialogue sequences. These events were varied but can be sorted in a few general types. There were time-limited upgrades or advantages, which included upgrading inventory items, enabling infinite use of said items, increasing certain enemy drops, and even discount sales on all merchant items. Additionally, the old man would sometimes use one of three support spells, which would summon a fairy for healing, freeze all enemies on screen, or destroy all enemies, respectively. The final category covers changes to the gameplay environment, which can include obstacles vanishing, enemies being strengthened or weakened, fairy springs losing their power, and even a limited time pickups (most notably, the\n   Red Ring\n   and\n   \n    Magical Sword\n   \n   were only available for a short period during week 4).\n  \n\n   The chance to fight\n   \n    Ganon\n   \n   was only accessible for the last 15 minutes of gameplay, and it took the place of the cave where the Wooden Sword was obtained. The character used the Triforce in the second screen to open the door to Ganon's chamber. When he was defeated, the character could then talk to\n   \n    Zelda\n   \n   and leave the cave.\n  \n\n\n    Dungeons\n   \n\n\n\n    Map 1\n   \n\n\n   The first six dungeons in Map 1 are in the shape of a letter; when put together, it spells out \"St. GIGA.\" The other two dungeons are shaped like a skull and down arrow.\n  \n\n\n    Map 2\n   \n\n\n   Each of the dungeons in Map 2 are in the shapes of letters, which together spell out \"NiNtENDO.\"\n  \n\n\n    Listings\n   \n\n\n\n    Bosses\n   \n\n\n\n    Enemies\n   \n\n\n\n    Glitches\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n      Names in Other Regions\n     \n\n\n\n      Language\n     \n\n      Name\n     \n\n      Meaning\n     \n\n\n\n\n       Japanese\n      \n\n\n      BSゼルダの伝説 (\n      \n       BS Zelda no Densetsu\n      \n      )\n     \n\n      BS The Legend of Zelda\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      This article is a short summary of Shigeru Miyamoto.\n      NintendoWiki features\n      \n       a more in-depth article\n      \n      .\n     \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Shigeru Miyamoto\n      宮本 茂\n      みやもと しげる\n     \n\n\n\n      Current Position\n     \n\n\n       General producer of\n       \n\n         The Legend of Zelda\n        \n        series\n       \n\n\n\n\n\n      Birthday\n     \n\n\n       November 16, 1952\n      \n\n\n\n\n      Birthplace\n     \n\n\n       Sonobe, Kyoto, Japan\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Shigeru Miyamoto\n   \n   is a video game designer and producer, creator of\n   \n\n     The Legend of Zelda\n    \n    series\n   \n   .\n  \n\n\n\n     Contents\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n       1\n      \n\n       Biography\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       2\n      \n\n\n        The Legend of Zelda\n       \n       Games\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n       3\n      \n\n       Trivia\n      \n\n\n\n\n\n\n    Biography\n   \n\n\n   During his childhood, Miyamoto enjoyed exploring the countryside and hillsides around his home, which inspired the creation of\n   \n\n     The Legend of Zelda\n    \n\n   .\n   He joined\n   Nintendo\n   in 1977, where he began developing arcade games.
